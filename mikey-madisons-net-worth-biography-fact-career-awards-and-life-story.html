I was jumping up and down and listening to heavy metal, trying to get my adrenaline up, and all of a sudden, I was in a tent and on the ground. The camera is a microscope so it sees every little thing and every drop of sweat. I also wanted my face to&nbsp;be red. So I wanted her to be uninhibited in her excitement and joy, so I needed to prepare myself beforehand.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKWZoLK6ecyam6Krn6PAbrrErWSwp6KptW6uyKieq5mgncZussCcq2abkaeypr6Mmq6aqpSoeqK6w2ajop6VYsC1u9GyZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-fred-warner-injured-what-happened-to-fred-warner-1555201672.html><span>←</span><span>Is Fred Warner Injured?
