They divorced in 2005, and she accused him of having an extramarital affair with Marjorie Bridge while they were still married.</p><p>She also made YouTube videos accusing Steve of being physically and mentally abusive. They went to court over Wynton’s custody, and while Steve won custody, she received his home and a $40,000 monthly welfare payment until 2009. She received $1.9 million after 2009.</p><p>She was, however, ordered not to make any public statements against him, which she disobeyed. As a result, she was sentenced to 30 days in prison. In 2007, Steve married Majorie Bridge.
