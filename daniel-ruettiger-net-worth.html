Daniel Ruettiger is probably best-known by his nickname "Rudy", which is also the name of the 1993 film starring <a href=#>Sean Astin</a> that re-told his life story. As the movie depicts, after numerous attempts, Ruettiger became a student at Notre Dame in the mid seventies, with the hope of joining the football team. Despite being too short (he was 5 ft 6), Ruettiger was placed on the scout team. He was eventually put in a game as a defensive end. He quickly gained credibility when he sacked a quarterback in the only game he played. He was carried off the field by teammates, making him the only player (in the school history) to be carried off the field. Almost twenty years later, the blockbuster Rudy (1993) was made about his time as a Notre Dame Football player.</p><p>After the Notre Dame years, Ruettiger became a motivational speaker, giving talks to school-age children, university students and professional athletes. He's also co-written several books including Rudy's Insight for Winning in Life and Ruby &Friends. Ruettiger set up The Rudy Foundation, a non-for-profit organization which helps develop programs that has a positive impact on children's lives. The Rudy Award was created under the organization which recognizes children's achievements.</p><p>[The photo of Daniel Ruettiger on this page was taken by U.S. Air Force photo/John Turner and licensed via wikimedia/Creative Commons]</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6osDHpZytnaNku6e4jp2Yp6GVoXqzwcStq6Kflad6r7HTZq6oqqSdfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chase-daniel-has-made-a-stupid-amount-of-money-sitting-on-the-sidelines-as-a-career-backup-quarterback.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Chase Daniel Has Made A Stupid Amount Of Money Sitting On The Sidelines As A Career Backup Quarterba</span></a>
