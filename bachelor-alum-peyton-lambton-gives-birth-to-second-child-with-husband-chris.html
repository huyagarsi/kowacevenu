So maybe this is a boy?!?!”</span></p><p class=p2><span class=s1>Peyton had a rough first trimester and suffered from morning sickness. “This happened with Lyla James too, but I could lay in bed all day with her,” she noted on her blog in August. “This time I had to suck it up and find a way to parent while trying not to puke everywhere! I do have to give a shout-out to my amazing husband because he really stepped up and allowed me to have full days in bed when I needed it.”</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p2><span class=s1>The couple, who met through Bachelor friends in 2010, tied the knot in May 2012.</span></p><p>With reporting by Jen Peros</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGabmZOdsq270WaYpa2dYr2mxdOopWakkaKvtbvNZp6irpWoeqO10a2fZqyfYsCmr86nm2abmJ65pXnWoquhZZiqwKOtzZ1knKCinsBw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./will-chase.html><span>←</span><span>Will Chase - Bio, Age, Height, Single, Nationality, Career, Instagram, Wiki</span></a>
