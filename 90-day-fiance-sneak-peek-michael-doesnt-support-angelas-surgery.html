He’s gonna be 33, I’m gonna be 55. My skin’s going to change, and I’m going to start to look older than I am. And Michael is still going to be as young as he looked the day I married him. So if I’m not young, I need to at least look the damn part and it starts with my weight.“</p><p class=xmsonormal>The Nigeria native, however, tells her,&nbsp;“You know I like big things.
