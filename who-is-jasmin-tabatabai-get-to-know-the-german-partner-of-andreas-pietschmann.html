In 1979, she moved to Germany with her family and completed her schooling there. Upon finishing school, this actress went to the art college in Stuttgart to study drama. Jasmin has three siblings – a sister named Susann and two brothers called Amir and Azar.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wtfoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/jastatt.jpg><h2 id=jasmin-tabatabai8217s-career class=rb-heading-index-2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Jasmin Tabatabai’s career</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Upon completing her education, Jasmin embarked on a career in film. She got to play the main role in the 1992 Swiss film called Kinder der Landstrasse (Children of the Open Road). Winning an award for the film at the Amiens Film Festival was not something that she expected, though. Jasmin did a few roles here and there before an opportunity to star in Bandits came along. Jasmin’s music career helped play her part in the film. This multi-faceted actress even wrote most of the songs for that film. Although this actress has donned numerous roles in the 18 films she has been in so far, music has remained her true passion.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wtfoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/jashus.jpg><h2 id=jasmin8217s-love-life-8211-the-first-inning class=rb-heading-index-3><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Jasmin’s love life – The first inning!</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>From what we know, this German actress has been in a couple of long-term relationships. Her first love was a rock star named Tico Zamora. The man’s from America, and he met her in December 2001. Their love of music was what connected these two. The two began dating and even welcomed their child, a girl named Angelina, in 2002 before marrying a year later. Sadly, their relationship wasn’t blessed, and it broke down as quickly as it began. The two of them decided to separate in 2006 and divorced a couple of years later.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 id=jasmin-tabatabai-believes-in-second-chances class=rb-heading-index-4><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Jasmin Tabatabai believes in second chances!</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wtfoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/flmjas.jpg><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>This actress didn’t give up hope on love after breaking up with Tico. In fact, she got back on the saddle as soon as she got down from it. Jasmin met Andreas in 2007, and the two of them began dating each other. Although she loved him dearly, and she still does to this day, Jasmin wasn’t too keen on marrying the actor. She had already experienced the institution once before and was not willing to give it another go. Her relationship with Andreas has yielded her two kids – a daughter named Helena Leila and a son called Johan Anton. We hope that Jasmin and Andreas continue to live together happily forever.</span></p><h2 id=unknown-facts-about-jasmin-tabatabai class=rb-heading-index-5>Unknown Facts About Jasmin Tabatabai</h2><ul><li>Did you know that Jasmin’s parents first met at the Munich Beer Festival in 1956?</li><li>This actress is best friends with fellow actresses Katharina Abt and Nicolette Krebitz.</li><li>Did you know that she used to play in an all-women band called Even Cowgirls get the blues?</li><li>Jasmin Tabatabai won the award for Best Film Score at the 1997 Bavarian Film Awards.</li></ul><p>** All images in this post are from Instagram/External sources.
