Not only was he the babyface champion, but he was also in his home country.</p><p>The first match they had on January 4 stole the show and you could tell they were looking to do the same thing here just from their posture and facial expressions. They were as serious as it gets.</p><p>They seemed like they were pacing themselves at first, but after about a minute, both men started trying to hit some of their biggest moves on each other.</p><p>Callis tried to grab Omega's leg and the ref booted him from ringside. That allowed everyone to focus solely on the match in the ring from that point forward.</p><p>Anyone who is familiar with the abilities of Omega and Ospreay already knows this was a great match. It's tough to say if they outdid their previous performance because they felt like totally different matches. The first one was all about the tension of their first-ever singles bout whereas this one was about them trying to hurt each other.</p><p>The Cleaner was busted open when Ospreay slammed his head into the announce table several times. Omega did the same thing to him on the steel steps a few minutes later. They were both a bloody mess by the time they got back into the ring.</p><p>They each scored several near-falls as they started showing signs of the wear and tear they had suffered. Each time they went down, it took a little longer to get to their feet again. Callis made another appearance and hid behind his security guards in the aisle as Omega drilled Ospreay with a stiff knee.</p><p>Callis passed Ospreay his screwdriver while he was keeping the ref busy. He used it to escape the One-Winged Angel and hit the Stormbreaker, but Omega got his foot on the rope to break the pin.</p><p>Ospreay used Omega's own V-Trigger and One-Winged Angel against him, but The Cleaner kicked out at one to get a massive pop from the crowd. The challenger dumped him right on his head with a Tiger Driver 91 but still couldn't get the pin. He finally got the three-count after another Stormbreaker to regain the IWGP U.S. title.</p><p><b>Winner: </b>Will Ospreay</p><p><b>Notable Moments and Observations</b></p><ul class="atom bulletedList"><li>Callis and a pair of masked security guards flanked Ospreay for his entrance.&nbsp;</li><li>The crowd was chanting before they even did anything interesting.
