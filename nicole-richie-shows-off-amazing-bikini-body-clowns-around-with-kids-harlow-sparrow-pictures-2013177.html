The Fashion Star mentor, 31, has never looked better or happier than she looked on a recent beach trip with her kids, daughter <strong>Harlow</strong>, 5, and son <strong>Sparrow</strong>, 3. (Dad is Richie’s husband of more than two years, Good Charlotte rocker&nbsp;<strong>Joel Madden</strong>.)&nbsp;</p><p>Sporting a red bikini top and blue bottoms, Richie flaunted her tiny waist and lean legs as she clowned around with her little ones in an impromptu, just-for-fun photo shoot. One picture from the afternoon shows all three standing on rocks and waving their arms in the air in goofy poses.&nbsp;</p><p>Harlow, in a cute ruffled bikini, could be seen making what looked like a heart with her hands, while Sparrow, in printed swim trunks and a T-shirt, had his hands clasped above his head in a shark fin pose. Richie, meanwhile, flashed peace signs and made a funny face at the camera.</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=651 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="nicole richie bikini" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>The mom of two — once criticized for her pin-thin frame but sporting a toned, healthier figure now — has said she tries not to brag about all the adorable things her kids do. “[Parents] want to talk about their [children’s] spit-up and how cute their boogers are. I try to not be that mom,” she told <strong>Chelsea Handler</strong> earlier this year. “I know what is really cute and what I only think is cute.”</p><p>That said, she and her husband keep a record, just for themselves, of their kids’ sweetest moments. “My mom told me you should write down every cute thing that they do because you will forget,” she shared with <strong><a href=#>Us Weekly</a></strong>. “Joel and I really write down every adorable thing they do and save them.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=626 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="nicole richie bikini and kids" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Speaking about her parenting style with DuJour last fall, Richie said she wants Harlow and Sparrow to have as normal a life as possible. “One of the biggest differences in the way I’m raising my kids versus the way I was raised is that I was on tour a lot,” she explained of growing up the daughter of musician Lionel Richie. “I don’t really do that with my kids. It’s important to me that they have stability. I like them to be home.”</p><p>Which is not to say she’s a perfect mom. “There’s no right or wrong way to raise a family,” she told the mag. “Look, I don’t know anyone who can say they don’t just try and do the best that they can do.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGanoZOkuaZ50aKaoaGVYsCpu9asZKielmKurq3ZoqWgZZKeuKq6yGaZqJypYrCtu9anqmaZoqTCr7CMsKCtoF2gtqW%2FjKGYq6SfrHq0vMCrqaivXaW2pMDUq5ysZWJlfnR9lnBm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mariska-hargitay.html><span>←</span><span>Mariska Hargitay News - Us Weekly</span></a>
