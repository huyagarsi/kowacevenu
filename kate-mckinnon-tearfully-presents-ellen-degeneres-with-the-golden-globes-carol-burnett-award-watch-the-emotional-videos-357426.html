The show was canceled in May 1998 after a successful five seasons and it seemed that Ellen’s career was over. She was lambasted for being gay and the rejection she experienced is beyond imaginable. She then went on to host her own talk show in 2003. For the past 17 years, Ellen has gone on to be one of the foremost voices on television. At 61-years-old, Ellen DeGeneres has redefined television and she did so by being her authentic self.</p><p>Kate McKinnon (who celebrates her 36th birthday today) tearfully introduced Ellen and she made it abundantly clear that Ellen’s strength and commitment to being a loud voice for the gay community gave her the strength to believe in herself.&nbsp; Kate is known for her incredible sense of humor, but during her introductory speech, her eyes welled up with tears. So too did Ellen’s, Carol Burnett’s, many in the audience, and viewers at home.</p><p>Here is a photo of Ellen DeGeneres seated next to Carol Burnett as Kate McKinnon delivered her remarks.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-357440 alt width=1200 height=800 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Ellen-DeGeneres-and-Carol-Burnett-Golden-Globes.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-357440 class=wp-caption-text>Carol Burnett and Ellen DeGeneres attend the 77th Annual Golden Globe Awards at the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, CA on Sunday, January 5, 2020.</p><p>You may watch Kate Mckinnon deliver her speech at the 77th Golden Globe Awards in the video player below.</p><p></p><p>Ellen DeGeneres followed Kate McKinnon and it was clear she was visibly touched.
