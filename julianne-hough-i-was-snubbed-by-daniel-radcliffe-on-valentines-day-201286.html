I wrote him a love note,” she confessed. “It was Valentine’s Day and I got him the Valentino Beanie Baby. I never heard back.”</p><p>Hough admitted that she’s now “really embarrassed” about her childhood crush “because sometimes I see him around. I just turn and walk away.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>When host <strong>Kelly Ripa</strong>, 41, asked if she’d ever confronted Radcliffe, Hough shook her head. “No! I’m too nervous.”</p><p>Guest host <strong>Neil</strong> <strong>Patrick</strong> <strong>Harris</strong>, 38, assured Hough that everything happens for a reason. “Had he written you back, you could have had a long relationship with Daniel Radcliffe. And now you’re stuck with <strong>Ryan Seacrest</strong>!”</p><p>Hough’s latest film, Rock of Ages, is in theaters June 15; it’s based on the popular Broadway musical. It also stars <strong>Tom Cruise</strong>, <strong>Mary J. Blige</strong>, <strong>Russell Brand</strong>, <strong>Malin</strong> <strong>Akerman</strong>, <strong>Alec</strong> <strong>Baldwin</strong>, <strong>Catherine</strong> <strong>Zeta-Jones</strong> and <strong>Diego</strong> <strong>Boneta</strong>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKGupJmWu6%2BxjKGmrp%2BYYrZuw8CsZKympZevprCMm7BmnJGjtqa4jKuYnZucnrOnsYyopWaukaGyr8DIp5ysZZSWxm5%2Bj2ppcW4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alyssa-naeher-twin-sister-amanda-naeher.html><span>←</span><span>Alyssa Naeher Twin Sister | Ecelebritymirror</span></a>
