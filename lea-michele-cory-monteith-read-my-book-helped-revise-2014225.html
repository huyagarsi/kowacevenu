<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Lea Michele: Cory Monteith Read My Book, Helped Revise</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong><a href=#>Cory Monteith</a></strong> had a hand in shaping girlfriend <strong><a href=#>Lea Michele</a></strong>'s memoir, Brunette Ambition, before he passed away last July. The Glee actress opened up about the process behind compiling her first book while speaking with bestie <strong>Jonathan Groff </strong>for a book signing Q&A Wednesday, May 21, at Barnes & Noble Union Square in NYC.</p><p>"I did write a lot in the book about you coming out to me," Michele, 27, said to Groff, "and what that was like.” (Glee guest star Groff came out publicly in 2009, announcing he was "gay and proud.")</p><p>"I remember Cory telling me when he read the book, 'You have to be… You've got to be careful because you're talking about someone.'" Heeding her late boyfriend's advice, Michele "edited down that chapter a lot."</p><p>"I think when you're writing a book, it's very important to think about the people [you're] talking about," the singer-actress explained. "I really wanted to talk about everyone a lot." Going against her nature of wanting to spill details, Michele said she remains coy when asked about her fellow Glee costars. "You have to take into consideration: How will I affect them?" Michele told the crowd.</p><p>Indeed, Michele has remained mum about <strong><a href=#>Naya Rivera</a></strong>'s abrupt departure from the Fox show last month. As previously reported, rumors abounded that Rivera <a href=#>was fired after a disagreement with producers</a> and that she complained to show runners about Michele's standout role.</p><p>"A little regret if anything," Michele explained of her new book, was: "I do wish I could have gotten a little bit deeper in the Glee chapter… there's so much that I wanted to talk about it."</p><p>That same chapter was also the most difficult to write.</p><p>"There was so much," Michele recalled. "To put into words what the past 6 years has been like—on a show—was really hard. It's been hard for me to explain what these experiences were like [and to put them] into words."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Though Michele made very few mentions of Monteith in her first book, she ended up dedicating it to the late actor, thanking him for being her biggest fan.</p><p>"Maybe years down the road, I'll be able to really, really say what it meant to me," she mused. For now, as she's shooting the sixth and final season of Glee, "It is very hard to comment on the experience."</p><p>"I mean, I'm 27, so I think I've got some time for that."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKOemV2itqS0xKWcZpufp8Zuuc6nq56hpJ16s7HAnWSmsV2XvLC3jKGcpaiVmXqzsdWiqp5lYmV%2BdX6Rbg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jennifer-love-hewitt-my-big-boobs-have-always-served-me-well-201273.html><span>←</span><span>Jennifer Love Hewitt: My Big Boobs Have &amp;quot;Always Served Me Well&amp;quot;</span></a>
