From the full fringe of the ‘60s to the ‘70s feathered look to the ‘80s voluminous variants, the face-framing snip serves as an aesthetic marker of a particular season, all of which have their place in today’s freeform beauty world. And as for ‘90s bangs? Those may be the most relevant of all.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Bangs in the ‘90s were worn almost as an accessory,” says hairstylist Justin Toves-Vincilione. “They were part of the haircut, but they weren’t the focal point—they were there, but they were more of a whisper, while the makeup, hairstyle, and fashion were the shout.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_4-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">‘90s bangs were a study in shape, worn blunt and imperfect or wispy and blown round, depending on the desired style. “Wispy pieces make a bang feel ‘90s—something with a little more bend and texture,” says hairstylist Justine Marjan. The soft glamour of the delicate snip was countered by cut-across fringe trimmed for a somewhat unfinished finish, a nod to the decade’s grunge sensibilities. The styles balanced subversiveness and glamour, all with a dose of well-blended subtlety.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading>Meet the expert</h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The best part? Each look feels as fresh and fashionable as it did decades ago. “In my opinion, all 1990s bangs need to make a comeback, and stay for good!” says Toves-Vincilione. Here, 20 styles that prove the point.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-face-framers></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Face-Framers</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Frank Hempel/United Archives via Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“One that has made a huge comeback, along with an incredible evolution, is Claudia Schiffer’s blunt, face-framing bangs,” says Toves-Vincilione. “They have the right amount of softness but are blunt overall with the perfect taper at each end.” The stylist notes that though the style wasn’t necessarily the most common or popular in the decade itself, its introduction served as the foundation for today’s ubiquitous <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>curtain bangs</a>.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-piecey-pixie></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Piecey Pixie</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Mitchell Gerber/Corbis/VCG via Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The piecey fringe that comes along with an elvish pixie is as enduring as Winona Ryder’s cool girl mystique. A new guard of close crops, shags, and mullets means that adapting this abbreviated frame is as natural a move as the bang itself—and easy to shift to suit your face shape and texture.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-baby-blunt></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Baby Blunt</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Rose Hartman/Archive Photos/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The blunt bangs of the ‘90s veered away from the long and modish ilk of decades past, moving above the brow and snipped with a disregard for uniformity. “The blunt and imperfect bang was a fun trend that was popular in the ‘90s, really showcasing that perfectly imperfect hair vibe that was very much the vibe back then,” says Toves-Vincilione. “Slightly uneven, a little choppy, but it made sense!” (Pssst: It still does!)</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-wisp></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Wisp</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Vinnie Zuffante/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Toves-Vincilione considers the wispy bang the most memorable of the entire decade. “They were perfectly tapered at the ends, piecey, and curled ever so slightly to suit the face shape,” he says. To get the look, Toves-Vincilione recommends reaching for an extra-large boar bristle round brush (or a size that seems large in comparison to the length of your bangs) and focusing on shape over polish.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-organic-oomph></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Organic Oomph</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=28><p>Ron Galella, Ltd./Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Embracing one’s natural texture is more timeless than a trend, and snipping said texture into an organic bang can instantly transform a look. Mariah Carey’s curls are styled just enough to retain their coiled shape but not so coiffed that finger raking and the occasional zhuzh are off the table.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-full-sweep></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Full Sweep</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Barry King/WireImage</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Back in the ‘90s, Cameron Diaz was the queen of the sleek shag, a cut that came with a set of built-in bangs. This deep-sweep fringe frames Diaz’s bone structure to flattering effect while furthering the choppy nature of her cut.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-pin-straight-pieces></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Pin-Straight Pieces</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Steve Granitz/WireImage</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A blunt and ironed bob becomes even more Y2K-reminiscent when enhanced by a strategic snip. Britney Spears’ barely-there bangs are just a few small sections, beginning at the apple of her cheek and finishing in a jaw-grazing layer.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-polished-curtain></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Polished Curtain</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Jim Smeal/Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Another precursor to today’s curtain bang, Monica’s hyper-polished fringe plays up an equally sleek updo. Trimmed to taper and accentuate her cheekbones, the singer’s bangs are parted askew, the better to create a sweet, glamorous, and red-carpet-ready frame.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-cut-across-wisp></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Cut-Across Wisp</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Jim Spellman/WireImage</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As with Cindy Crawford’s iconic wisped bangs, Sandra Bullock’s fringe is all about that delicate rounded shape. The difference lies in the cut: rather than tapering off, Bullock’s bangs are cut straight across, left separate from her long layers rather than painstakingly blended. Pick your poison—the styling routine remains the same.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-bowed-blunt></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Bowed Blunt</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=28><p>Ron Galella, Ltd./Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Tatyana Ali’s blunt bangs were snipped to arch over the eyebrows in a take on the baby bang trend. To get the look, Toves-Vincilione suggests starting with an ample application of volumizing mousse. “Blow dry your bangs with your hands or a detangling brush if you’re curly, and style your bangs by directionally drying them side to side until they lay forward perfectly,” he says. “Curly hair may require a brush that’s made for smoothing.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-curly-curtain></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Curly Curtain</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Vinnie Zuffante/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Another variant of bangs made stronger for its curly texture, Sarah Jessica Parker’s spiraled curtain bangs—the shortest portion snipped to fall just past the eye line—lightens up her rounded cut while providing a fashionable frame.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-bombshell-bangs></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Bombshell Bangs</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>S.
