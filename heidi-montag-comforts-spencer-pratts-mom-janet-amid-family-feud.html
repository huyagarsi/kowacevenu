Before [<i>The Hills: New Beginnings</i>], my mom, my brother and I all sat down and we said, ‘We will not let this ruin our family again.”</p><p>Stephanie added that she’s “not protecting” Heidi and Spencer anymore and she is totally “done” with them: “You have to put on your own oxygen mask before you can put on someone else’s. … That’s what I’m doing right now. If my mom can’t handle this, that’s her issue. I cannot help her.”</p><p><a href=#>Heidi and Spencer clapped back</a> at the jewelry designer on the Monday, April 8, episode of their podcast. “It’s been a really hard week for me. I had a lot of on-<i>Hills </i>drama with a family member and that was very challenging and heartbreaking. I feel like there were some very below-the-belt, nasty comments that weren’t even true,” the <i>Laguna Beach </i>alum said, adding that people often target her because they mistake her “kindness for weakness.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Spenser-Pratt-Heidi-Pratt-Comfort-Mom.jpg><p>She continued: “You have to have boundaries. Family, not family, friends —<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp; </span>I don’t want my children to think it is OK to let themselves be treated a certain way and have people say certain things about them. There’s no way I’m not standing up for myself and my family.”</p><p>Spencer also defended his wife of almost 11 years during the episode, saying, “If you think you’re gonna walk on my sweet angel, Heidi, you have something coming your way.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGahnZmZtm65zqermp9dmLyuss6rq6xlo6Wyr6%2FEq2SpqpGpwbR5zKikZqKRo7K1ecCmoJ1llpa6qrjYZp2erZRk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./emily-in-paris-season-3-episode-5-recap-ooo-la-la-liste-html.html><span>←</span><span>Emily in Paris Recap: Making a List, Checking It Twice</span></a>
