(The AMPTP represents major companies such as Netflix, Amazon, Apple, Disney, Discovery-Warner, NBC Universal, Paramount and Sony.)</p><p>Some movies, however, <a href=#>were able to keep cameras rolling</a> because their scripts were finished before writers authorized the strike. Two months later, SAG-AFTRA announced its own strike, which meant <a href=#>actors joined writers on the picket lines.</a></p><p>Amid the historic dual strikes, SAG-AFTRA (Screen Actors Guild – American Federation of Television and Radio Artists) released a list of guidelines for members which broke down which projects were allowed to keep filming and which weren’t. Members of the SAG union are <a href=#>prohibited from filming or promoting most movie and TV projects</a> — past, present and future. This rule prevents actors from attending premieres and screenings in a promotional capacity, and they can’t promote any of their work on social media.</p><p>Actors are also prohibited from doing work that is on or off camera such as stunt work, motion capture work, stand-in work, camera tests and background work. Anyone hoping to become a member of the union in the future is expected to abide by the same guidelines or else they risk not being admitted to SAG-AFTRA.</p><p>SAG-AFTRA has since clarified that certain films — and TV shows — <a href=#>will be allowed to continue filming if they are approved</a> for an Interim Agreement. An application will be accepted if the movie is not produced by a studio that is a member of the AMPTP and agrees to union guidelines. Projects that have lowest-budget contracts with SAG-AFTRA are allowed to continue working as well.</p><p>In August 2023, SAG-AFTRA confirmed they would not be allowing deals to titles covered by a Writers Guild of America contract that are also produced in the U.S.</p><p>Scroll on for every movie that has kept filming amid the ongoing strike:</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Adult Best Friends<br>Aguadilla<br>American Deadbolt<br>American Nightmare<br>Anniversary<br>The Ar Racist<br>Armadilla<br>Beneath the Grass<br>Beyond the Walls<br>Bob Trevino Likes It<br>Bootyology<br>Bride Hard<br>The Cafone<br>Conduit<br>Death of a Unicorn<br>A Desert<br>Don’t Move<br>Dos Lados<br>Dream Devil<br>Dust Bunny<br>Exhibiting Forgiveness<br>F-Plus<br>Flight Risk<br>Fluxx<br>From Ashes<br>Ganymede<br>The Greatest Ever</p><p>Ick<br>Isaac<br>Just Breathe<br>The Killer’s Game<br>King Ivory<br>Legend of the White Dragon<br>Mother Mary<br>Mother, May I?<br>Mourning Rock<br>My Valentine Wedding<br>Osiris<br>Paradise and Lunch<br>Queen of the Ring<br>The Ritual<br>Rivals of Azmiah King<br>Roses on the Vine<br>Sell Out<br>The Short Game<br>Sod and Stubble<br>The Sound<br>The Summer Book<br>Sunfish (& Other Stories on Green Lake)<br>Superthief<br>The Killer’s Game<br>Til Death … Do You<br>The Tower<br>Transamazonia<br>Until He’s Destroyed<br>Untitled Jazzy Project<br>Untitled Rebuilding Project<br>The Watchers<br>Week End Escape Project<br>Wildcat<br>The Wilderness<br>The Yellow Tie<br>Young Claude</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKSorpmawG6ty6WmsJ2UYsGwecqenKlllp65rrXNoGSapZmZerizwGaqmp9dqMGztcqeqmg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./la-times-the-slightest-bit-5-letters-crossword-clue-1234404.html><span>←</span><span>LA Times The slightest bit 5 letters Crossword Clue</span></a>
