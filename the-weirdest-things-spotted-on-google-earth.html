Did someone make it specifically for Google Earth?</p><p>Surprisingly, no. The rabbit began construction before Google Earth was publicly released. A fully knit creation, it was built by a Viennese art collective called Gelitin, <a href=#>according to Amusing Planet</a>. It was completed in 2005, but was actually started <a href=#>five years earlier</a>. The rabbit, simply called Rabbit, was just meant to be a large and unexpected stuffed animal in the middle of nowhere, an art piece. What's more, some details weren't well-captured by Google Earth, such as a creepy strand of entrails coming from the rabbit's side and a horrified expression on its face.</p><p>While the rabbit was initially pink, time and weather slowly turned it gray. Since Rabbit was made using standard knitting materials, it wasn't built to last, intentionally so. As of 2019, all that remains of the bunny is a vague, long-eared shape. The creation is expected to eventually be completely decayed within a few years, and the artists have no intentions of preserving it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9lnJwaWlfqbWmedaeoKuclajBbsDHoqWgq12ovbDA056bZqeeYrSwu8alnGadkafBqXs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shelley-hack-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Shelley Hack Net Worth 2024: Income Sources, Real Estate and Financial Overview</span></a>
