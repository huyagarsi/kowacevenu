Ohio State suspended Meyer for his handling of domestic violence allegations against former wide receivers coach Zach Smith.

In that case, the firing would be without cause.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But Meyer retiring instead of being fired works out nicely for the university. They don't owe him any money besides what they've already paid him.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>We may still see Meyer on the sidelines at another university or even at the pro level. But for now, he'll coach one more game and then ride off into the sunset – with plenty of money in his pocket.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2Fjq6pm5meYrqmxcSrZKKrXaeytbXRoqWgZZGjsW7AwKSgp59daIZuucilo6KnnmLEqsDHZp%2BipV2XwrV5yK1knKelobFutMCvnGaalZq7brHVnqVmpZ%2BnsnA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pollyanna-mcintosh-walking-dead-bio-wiki-age-height-husband-net-worth-movies-and-tv-shows.html><span>←</span><span>Pollyanna McIntosh Walking Dead, Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Husband, Net Worth, Movies and TV Shows</span></a>
