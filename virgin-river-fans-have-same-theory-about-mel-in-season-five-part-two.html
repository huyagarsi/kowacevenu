Spoiler ahead for season five of Virgin River…</strong></p><p id=eLHq_0eMXiJ data-wc=74>Taking to social media, many have been sharing the theory that they Mel could be in a for shock when she finds out the identity of her father. In the trailer, Mel discovers that her dad could be a resident of the small town, posing the question that she may have already crossed paths with him without him knowing – this has led some to believe it could be Doc, played by Tim Matheson.</p><p id=eGqN_uqFk68 data-wc=22>"We did it.

Communication is so important and I think they handled it beautifully. I just love how they suffered through this together. It was a testament to their love story. I am still hurt and disappointed but am hopeful for them."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/56e8fbca2d23-vr-mel-jack.jpg><p id=ec6ijfU3gZo data-wc=12><strong>Virgin River season five part two lands on Netflix on November 30.&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm7atuY5uZ2tvYm58t7XRoKCnZaKew6a%2BjJ%2BYp6tdna63sYysmKadXam1prvRsmSamp%2BqwW65xKVkoqZdqLKiv86nZJ%2Bhppp6sa3RrWStr59k</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./richest-celebrities.html><span>←</span><span>Tony Todd Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</span></a>
