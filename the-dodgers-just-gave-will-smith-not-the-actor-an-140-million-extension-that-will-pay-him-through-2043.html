This MLB season is officially underway, but the Dodgers aren't done spending.
The Dodgers and catcher Will Smith agreed to a ten-year, $140 million contract. Smith, who just turned 29 years old, should remain in Los Angeles for the rest of his career — and he'll be paid until well after he retires."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

He'll receive $15 million of that bonus in November 2024 and the other $15 million in January 2025. The majority of his contract ($90 million) will be paid out over the next ten seasons, though a portion of it will be deferred.</p><p>From 2034 to 2043, Smith will get $5 million per season. That money won't accrue any interest, but it's yet another big-money, long-term deal on the books for the Dodgers. Beyond Ohtani and Yamamoto, the Dodgers also have <a href=# rel=noopener>Mookie Betts</a> on a $365 million contract that expires after the 2032 season.</p><p>Like Smith, Ohtani will continue earning money long after his deal technically ends. Most of his money is deferred; he'll get $2 million per season for the next ten years, with the remaining $680 million of his contract coming from 2034 to 2043.</p><p>Smith, who was drafted in 2016, reached his first All-Star team last season, and the Dodgers expect him to take another big leap this year. He'll continue to be a threat in the lineup alongside Betts and <a href=# rel=noopener>Freddie Freeman</a>, with Ohtani adding another impressive bat to the roster.</p><p>Both of these contracts are designed to give the Dodgers more financial flexibility for the short-term. By owing less money to some players over the next few seasons, the team has room to offer big deals to other players. And they clearly aren't shy about spending.</p><p>Will it turn into another title? The Dodgers have been perennial contenders but have only won one championship since 1988, which happened during the COVID-19-shortened 2020 season.</p><p>Yet the Dodgers are once again going all in. If they win the World Series — or multiple championships — the investment will be well worth it. Otherwise, it'll be another expensive disappointment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2Fjq2fnmWUpLGosdGsZKOto6l6qK3VnmSwoZyherS5yK2fZqafqXq1tMRmmJysn6d6orqMamtpZZ2eua21zqdknrCkmru0tc6nZK2gkal6uLXLpWSpmalitaq5jK2fq6elnLVufo9tamg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./it-a-dark-and-stormy-night-html.html><span>←</span><span>It ___ a dark and stormy night ...</span></a>
