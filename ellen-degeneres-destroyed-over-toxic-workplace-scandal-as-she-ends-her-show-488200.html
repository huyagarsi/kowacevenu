Ellen DeGeneres stated the following.</p><p>With the talk show, all I cared about was spreading kindness and compassion and everything I stand for was being attacked, So, it destroyed me, honestly. I‚Äôd be lying if I said it didn‚Äôt. And it makes me really sad that there‚Äôs so much joy out there from negativity. It‚Äôs a culture now where there are just mean people, and it‚Äôs so foreign to me that people get joy out of that.</p><p>https://twitter.com/CancelCultureTM/status/1395619468647313408</p><p>What do you think about Ellen DeGeneres ending the show?
