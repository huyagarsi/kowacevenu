I don’t,” she told <a href=#>TMZ</a>. “He was at my friend’s party and we took a picture with a bunch of people and that’s it. I don’t know him. I’ve not even had a conversation with him.”</p><p>Azalea then insisted that she and Beckham had “a long way to go” before becoming an item, adding, “I don’t watch football! I saw Lady Gaga [perform] at the Super Bowl, that’s it.”</p><p>A source close to the NFL pro tells Us that he is indeed dating the entertainer, but it is not exclusive. “They hook up, but are still hooking up with other people,” the insider shares.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>After his bowling outing with the “Team” rapper, the athlete — who is sitting out the remainder of the current NFL season due to an ankle injury — was briefly linked to model <strong>Polyxeni Ferfeli</strong>.
