On Sunday, Pepper uploaded a prank video (you’ll find many such videos on his channel) in which he carries out an elaborate ruse to scare the shit out of one half of the Vine star duo <a href=#>Sam Golbach and Colby Brock</a>. In the video, Pepper kidnaps Colby (who was in on the prank) and Golbach and takes them to a rooftop where Pepper pretends to shoot and kill Colby in front of an absolutely petrified Golbach. (“We’re just kids from Kansas!” Golbach can be heard screaming through tears.) They then let the cameras roll while Golbach — who’s been tied to a chair the whole time — screams and cries for about a minute, believing his best friend has just been murdered, until Colby comes back from the dead and reveals the prank. They hug it out eventually and film an outro for the video two days later with Pepper, in which Golbach gives the two “props” for their “insane” trickery.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-06db9c86aa078ccb692d03a82f252101-4-0-0@published data-word-count=120>But, as is the case with any prank that plays emotional trauma for laughs, Pepper’s now been vilified on social media. MTV <a href=#>says</a> he’s “disgusting,” while some of Pepper’s own fans (and the majority of his haters) want him banned from the site. YouTube <a href=#>reportedly</a> won’t be removing the video because it technically doesn’t violate community guidelines, but this isn’t the first time Pepper has outraged the ever-expanding YouTube universe. Last year, Pepper was accused of sexual harassment after he uploaded <a href=#>a different prank video</a> that showed him pinching several women’s butts as he stopped them for directions. That video <i>was</i> taken down, and Pepper <a href=#>later claimed</a> it was part of a staged “social experiment” about street harassment and gender.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-06db9c86aa078ccb692d03a82f252101-5-0-0@published data-word-count=26>Pepper has yet to comment on his latest backlash, except to retweet a post from Golbach about how the prank only strengthened his friendship with Colby:</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>For those of you that watched Sam Pepper's video... <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/vg7C9coKR0</a></p>— samuel (@SamGolbachh) <a href=#>November 29, 2015</a><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-06db9c86aa078ccb692d03a82f252101-7-0-0@published data-word-count=23>Sam and Colby have also shared a seperate message, saying the prank wasn’t intended to be funny but “to show a true friendship.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Some people are getting the wrong idea and speaking on my behalf...<br>-Sam <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/05rGAlHVUg</a></p>— Sam and Colby 2.0 (@SamandColby) <a href=#>November 30, 2015</a> <span class=ambrose-short-hed>Did This YouTube Star’s Murder Prank Go Too Far?</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlobmdhZnyltcNmq6Gho2LGsMHTrpmeZaOprrO%2FjKasq5yVp3qxvsCnomafn2LBsLuMn5irZpipuq0%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chris-jericho-took-a-walk-down-memory-lane-after-wwe-featured-him-in-raw-30th-anniversary-video.html><span>←</span><span>Chris Jericho Took A Walk Down Memory Lane After WWE Featured Him In Raw 30th Anniversary Video</span></a>
