The Power star faced backlash after kissing <a href=#><strong>Beyoncé</strong></a> at the 2019 NAACP Image Awards.</p><p>Hardwick, 45, posed for a photo with Queen Bey’s husband, <a href=#><strong>Jay-Z</strong></a>, in the audience at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood on Saturday, March 30, while Beyoncé chatted with her protégés Chloe x Halle before the ceremony kicked off. Hardwick then made his way over to the “Hold Up” singer and greeted her with a kiss on the cheek followed by a hug. As he pulled away, he gave her a second kiss closer to her mouth.</p><p>Beyoncé’s fiercely protective fan base was quick to spark a conversation about personal space while calling out Hardwick as a video of the interaction circulated on Twitter.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Beyoncé has arrived! 👑&nbsp;<a href=#>#NAACPImageAward</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/4GEXScVOma</a></p><p>— BEYONCÉ LEGION (@BeyLegion) <a href=#>March 31, 2019</a></p><p>“Ghost did too damn much,” one member of the Beyhive tweeted, using the nickname of the actor’s Power character, to which another fan responded, “He caught her off guard; she looked flustered! ‘Ghost, that’s Beyonce, not Angela [<strong>Lela Loren</strong>’s character].’ The #Power she possesses! Some people get weird around her. But, I do think it was an innocent, unintentional peck.”</p><p>Other Twitter users pointed out that the 23-time Grammy winner did not appear to expect a second kiss.</p><p>“@OmariHardwick 2nd kiss was unnecessary & uncomfortable. Don’t do that again,” one person tweeted. “We women so often get touched, kissed, groped & poked in instances exactly like this (at an event, at work, etc). WE DON’T LIKE IT. It’s time to no longer let these moments of discomfort slide.”</p><p>Another fan wrote, “Damn, Beyoncé looked extremely uncomfortable. Omari Hardwick [might] have just got the new season of power cancelled messing around with the Beyhive.”</p><p>Some tweeters, however, came to Hardwick’s defense.</p><p>“The video of Omari Hardwick and Beyonce is definitely awkward as hell, but I think that’s it,” one fan wrote. “An awkward interaction. I don’t get what this extra stuff is all about.”</p><p>As the Kick-Ass star’s name started to trend on Twitter, another user echoed that “most people, celebrities included, still have awkward interactions with people they admire.”</p><p>Beyoncé and Jay-Z, 49, were on hand at the NAACP Image Awards to accept the Entertainer of the Year Award and the President’s Award, respectively.</p><p>Saturday marked the second time in just over a week that the Beyhive was on the attack. After <a href=#><strong>Tamera Mowry</strong></a> admitted on March 20 that she <a href=#>once felt charmed by Jay-Z</a>, Beyoncé’s fans flooded the Real cohost’s Instagram comments section with bee emojis.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I try not to look at that stuff,” Mowry, 40, told Us on Saturday. “I never thought it was <a href=#>going to be a big deal</a>.”</p><p>Us Weekly has reached out to Hardwick’s rep for comment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaopZGntm60wKubsKGToHqnrcKeqmaakZi4ra3SoWSfp6JiuKq%2F0qKloGWSmsawusKeZJqsXaOuoq%2FPZpiwmaKZwHA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jonathan-bennett.html><span>←</span><span>Jonathan Bennett</span></a>
