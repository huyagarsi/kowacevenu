However, this information will be updated as soon as it is available.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=cecile-daughter></span>Cecile Daughter<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The dancehall artiste has a daughter born on 28 August 2012, whose names have not been shared with the public.

They had dated for about four years and even share a two and a half-year-old daughter as a memory of their love. Although much has yet to be said about their break up, Cecile has come out to comment about their break up in few words.</p><p>The amazing singer decided to focus solely on her music saying she is currently working with big wigs Richie Loop, Sparrow Blaxx and her brother Don Rican. She further added that theirs was a cordial break up and that they have maintained an epic friendship even though they are apart.</p><p>Rumor has it that they drifted apart thanks to Chris’ party life but Cecile is yet to comment on that and neither has Chris Martin. She, however, said he is a great dad. “I lost a boyfriend, my daughter has not lost a dad. It should never be entangled. He’s a good dad,”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=cecile-famous></span>Cecile Famous<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Today Cécile is known internationally.
