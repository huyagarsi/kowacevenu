Pentatonix, an Acappella group is one of those who has taken Acappella singing to a new level that has seen them achieve global fame. One of the members of this group of trendsetters is Matt Sallee, a second bass in the group of five.</p><p>While the group mostly consists of original members who still remain part of the group, Matt Sallee is a new member who joined the group in 2017 and has already been a part of five albums released by the group.</p><p>For fans of Pentatonix and admirers of Matt Sallee, learn all you need to know about the singer below.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=matt-sallee-biography-age></span><strong>Matt Sallee Biography & Age</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>When Avi Kaplan announced he was leaving Pentatonix, several fans of the group who had grown up with him as a member were understandably disappointed but his decision to leave paved the way for Matt Sallee, an equally talented singer to join the group.</p><p>Matt Sallee was born on the 11th of February, 1994 in San Antonio, Texas to E.

His journey as a young singer has seen him perform at the Kennedy Center, Apollo Theater and Morman Temper Visitors Center.</p><p>With such an impressive CV as a singer at a young age, it came as no surprise that he was the group’s pick to replace the void left by Avi Kaplan’s absence.
