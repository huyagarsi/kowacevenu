She is beautiful inside and out. Don’t change beautiful, and your humbleness is very inspirational.<br>Either way, she is gorgeous! She looks so much like her grandmother to me. wish @kandyburruss would get more pics taken with this young woman…👏👏🏻👏keep up the excellent work Kandy.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/By0HBhklta8/</p><p>A second follower added: “Looks totally different from when she was on her trip with dad!! Great bundles, wigs, and lil makeup is a wonderful thing too cute 🙌🏼Y’all are beautiful love the bond you have with your kids😍This hair is so dope on you! That is how she must look at all the time not just when social media need it<br>You look amazing!”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BzO3zLTgsd-/</p><p>Another commenter penned this note on social media: “Don’t start messing up that beautiful skin…wear real light more like natural…u don’t need all that to look gorgeous…u a pretty young lady anyway. Be you. You’re beautiful. Love you for who you are. You’d shine just as bright in your natural hair and fresh face. 💕Beauty lives within and shines outward.
