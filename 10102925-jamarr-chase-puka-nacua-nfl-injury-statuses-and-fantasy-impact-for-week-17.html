At the least, Chase has a chance to go...</p><p>Chase is officially listed as questionable with the shoulder injury that he suffered two weeks ago against the Minnesota Vikings.</p><p>The star wide out missed the Bengals' Week 16 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers and he would provide a massive boost to the offense in Week 17 against Kansas City.</p><p>Cincinnati needs a win on Sunday to keep its AFC wild-card hopes alive. The Bengals sit in 10th place with an 8-7 record after the loss to the Steelers.</p><p>If Chase plays, he should receive a heavy amount of targets from Jake Browning. If he sits, the same fantasy thought process should go into his replacements as last week.</p><p>Tee Higgins and Tyler Boyd earned 15 targets from Browning last week, while Andrei Iosivas saw a production increase with four catches on eight targets.</p><p>Iosivas and Trenton Irwin are the internal wide receiver replacements to add off the waiver wire if Chase can't play.</p><p>Demarcus Robinson, Rashid Shaheed and Greg Dortch and Cedrick Wilson are among the possible waiver-wire replacements from outside the Bengals roster.</p><p>Dortch and Wilson could be in the spotlight more than previous weeks because of injuries to Marquise Brown and Jaylen Waddle.</p><p><b>Puka Nacua Listed As Questionable, But Will Play</b></p><p>Nacua's questionable listing appears to be only a procedural move by the Rams since he did not practice on Friday.</p><p>McVay indicated the breakout star of fantasy football leagues will play on Sunday against the Giants.</p>Jourdan Rodrigue <span class=acct>@JourdanRodrigue</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Per Sean McVay, Puka Nacua had some tightness in his hip and won't practice today, could be listed as questionable but his status should not be affected for Sunday. &lt;br>Ernest Jones is under the weather but McVay also expects him to be OK for Sunday.</p><p>Nacua is needed by the Rams and fantasy football players to shine at MetLife Stadium. He is coming off a nine-catch, 164-yard performance against the New Orleans Saints.</p><p>Nacua has the potential to be one of Week 17's highest point scorers because of his matchup with the Giants. The Rams need him on the field to stay ahead of the Seattle Seahawks and other chasers in the NFC wild-card race.</p><p>If Nacua's status drops to out, Demarcus Robinson would be the most popular waiver-wire pickup. Robinson scored in four straight games and has eight catches in the last two games.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYGeGc4GMo5immaKneqS0wKycZqiloK5uusCcrJplnpu5brXNo6yrsV2owaLA1KycrGWRo7FussCnq5qrqWK2rrzAnKtmnp%2BnerixxKRkam8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./clint-robertson.html><span>←</span><span>Clint Robertson</span></a>
