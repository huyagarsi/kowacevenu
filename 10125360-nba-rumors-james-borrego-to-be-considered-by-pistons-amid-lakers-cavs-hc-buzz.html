The Lakers job is unlikely after they met with Borrego twice and still focused their search on other candidates—most notably UConn coach Dan Hurley and ESPN analyst JJ Redick—but Borrego is a strong option in Detroit and Cleveland.</p><p>Borrego, 46, previously did a strong job with the rebuilding Charlotte Hornets from 2018 to 2022. The Hornets went 138-163 under Borrego but were 43-39 during his final season with the team, and his firing was considered a surprise at the time. Charlotte has won a combined 48 games the last two seasons since firing Borrego.</p><p>The Pistons job fits Borrego's reputation as a builder of young talent. Detroit has missed the playoffs for five straight seasons but has no team cohesion to show for it. The Pistons lavished Monty Williams with a six-year, $78.5 million contract last offseason only to fire him a year later after a miserable 14-68 campaign.</p><p>While the Detroit roster is littered with high lottery picks, none have turned into surefire stars. Cade Cunningham, the top pick in the 2021 NBA draft, is the most promising of the bunch but still hasn't developed into a consistent, high-level performer. Given the fact the 2024 NBA draft is not considered rife with talent, the Pistons are unlikely to find that gem with the No. 5 pick next week.</p><p>By contrast, the Cavaliers have made the playoffs two straight seasons and have a bonafide All-Star on their roster already in Donovan Mitchell. If Borrego has a choice between the two jobs and wants to compete immediately, Cleveland will be where he winds up.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmqAd3yMp5maZaKqurC%2B0mahmqWVqHqju9GrnKCnXam8bq7EZpqopqOesaa%2BxJ1km7Fdpba0wM6nqmaZnZ6xbrjApJyrq12Yrre%2FjKGaZpqlr8c%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./monica-bellucci-s-father-insists-the-bond-girl-has-never-had-plastic-surgery-47584.html><span>←</span><span>Monica Belluccis Father Insists the Bond Girl Has Never Had Plastic Surgery</span></a>
