She also said he had penetrated her anally while unconscious without her prior consent.</p><p>In a statement to Ghiroli and Strang, Bauer's agent, Jon Fetterolf, said the allegations were "baseless, defamatory, and will be refuted to the fullest extent of the law."</p><p>A Los Angeles judge <a href=# rel=noopener>rescinded</a> the restraining order against Bauer in August 2021. The Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office <a href=# rel=noopener>announced</a> in February 2022 that the right-handed pitcher wouldn't face criminal charges.</p><p>In a separate report from April, <a href=# rel=noopener>Garcia-Roberts</a> noted a different woman in Columbus, Ohio, said Bauer "choked her unconscious without her consent" and "slapped her without her consent" in sexual encounters between the two.</p><p>Major League Baseball initially placed Bauer on administrative leave as it investigated the allegations. He was <a href=# rel=noopener>suspended</a> for 324 games (two full seasons) in April 2022 for violating MLB's joint domestic violence, sexual assault and child abuse policy.</p><p>The suspension did not include the 99 games Bauer missed while on administrative leave. An arbitrator reduced his <a href=# rel=noopener>suspension</a> to 194 games on appeal, retroactive to when it was first handed down.</p><p>The arbitrator also ruled Bauer would be fined for the first 50 games of the 2023 season. The Dodgers still owe him the $22.5 million remaining on the three-year, $102.1 million contract he signed in February 2021.</p><p>Signing in Japan will allow Bauer to pitch as soon as he's ready. The BayStars will open the 2023 regular season March 31 against Hanshin.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloZmWGcYCMramerp%2BneqOt1J6pZqKRpa6vv4yypqSnmJa6onnBmrCsrJGnwG6txqucnmWkpHqku82tqZqbpGKup8DEq2Sdp5ScsrO%2FjJ6voqw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sterling-monett.html><span>←</span><span>Sterling Monett</span></a>
