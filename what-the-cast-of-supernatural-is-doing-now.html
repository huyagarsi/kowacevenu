The show first aired in 2005, and there was a 5-season plan put into place. Due to the fans’ strong reaction to the show, Supernatural was able to continue for 15 seasons, finally coming to an end in 2020. With a total of 327 episodes, viewers were able to watch the male leads, Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki, grow up on screen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The show covered every sci-fi plot under the sun, ranging from ghosts and monsters to angelic battles. Supernatural culminated its final season by battling God himself, its main characters fighting for what they always have: free will. Now that the show is over, fans miss seeing their favorite characters on screen every week. Let’s catch up on what the cast has been up to since the end of this iconic show.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's Why 'Supernatural' Is The Longest Running Show On The CW</a></span></p><h2 id=jeffrey-dean-morgan-was-in-the-walking-dead><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Jeffrey Dean Morgan Was In The Walking Dead</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans will remember loving Jeffrey Dean Morgan before his days playing John Winchester on Supernatural. He played Denny Duquette during Grey’s Anatomy’s early seasons. Most recently, Morgan has been a cast member on The Walking Dead. He played Negan Smith and the show just came to an end this year after an 11-year run.</p><p>Morgan can thank his television son, Jensen Ackles, for meeting his wife. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Morgan was set up on a blind date with Hilarie Burton by Ackles</a>.</p><h2 id=mark-pellegrino-has-been-busy-with-netflix><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Mark Pellegrino Has Been Busy With Netflix</span></h2><p>Mark Pellegrino was in and out of Supernatural since season 5. His character, Lucifer, was killed off and brought back to life almost as many times as Sam and Dean Winchester. Pellegrino made a brief cameo in the show’s final season as he is a fan favorite. Since Supernatural, the actor has been busy with many projects. He played a parental role in <strong><a href=#>Netflix</a></strong>’s 13 Reasons Why and had a recurring role on American Rust.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mark-sheppard-rejoins-supernatural-co-star-jared-padalecki><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Mark Sheppard Rejoins Supernatural Co-Star Jared Padalecki</span></h2><p>Fans were devastated when Mark Sheppard’s character, Crowley, was killed off at the end of season 12. However, <a href=#>fans agreed it might have been time to say goodbye to the king of hell</a>. His character had one of the most drastic arcs, transitioning from a villain to a friend to the heroes of the show. He had been in the show since his introduction season 5, but the actor was ready to move on to different projects. Sheppard briefly appeared in the television show Doom Patrol and will now have a role in Walker: Independence. It seems the cast of Supernatural cannot stay away from each other for long!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's Why Jared Padalecki Came Close To Not Being Cast On 'Supernatural'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jim-beaver-in-the-boys-with-jensen-ackles><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Jim Beaver In The Boys With Jensen Ackles</span></h2><p>Jim Beaver also loves to stay connected with his Supernatural family. His role on the show, the parental Bobby Singer, was introduced in the show’s second season. Though his character died in season 7, the actor was given the opportunity to return to the show as a ghost, through flashbacks and even as an alternate-universe version of Bobby Singer. Now, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Beaver plays a small role on The Boys with the same character name</a>. The nod to Supernatural stems from the creator of The Boys, Eric Kripke, who also created Supernatural.</p><h2 id=alexander-calvert-joins-hbo-39-s-dead-boy-detective><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Alexander Calvert Joins HBO's Dead Boy Detective</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Alexander Calvert was a late addition to the cast of Supernatural. He joined the show at the end of season 12 and played Jack, the son of Lucifer. Anyone who knows Supernatural knows <a href=#>the cast has a lot of fun on set</a>. Fans of the show were used to seeing Misha Collins get pranked in blooper reels, but with the addition of Calvert, the dynamic shifted to the new kid on the block.</p><p>Now, Calvert is set to be a part of HBO’s Dead Boy Detective. He will be playing Thomas The Cat King. The young actor also has a passion for photography, and fans can see his work on his Instagram.</p><h2 id=misha-collins-writes-poetry><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Misha Collins Writes Poetry</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Misha Collins played the angel Castiel, and he was a favorite among fans. So much so that when the writers of Supernatural intended to kill off Collins’s character at the beginning of season 7, fans petitioned to bring the angel back. Collins returned later in season 7 and remained on the show until its end.</p><p>Since then, Collins has taken a brief break from acting to pursue his passion for poetry. At the end of 2021, he released a collection of poems titled, "Some Things I Still Can’t Tell You: Poems."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Supernatural: 10 Best Posts That Prove Jensen Ackles And Jared Padalecki's Bromance</a></span></p><h2 id=jared-padalecki-stars-in-walker><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Jared Padalecki Stars In Walker</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jared Padalecki hopped from one CW show to another.
