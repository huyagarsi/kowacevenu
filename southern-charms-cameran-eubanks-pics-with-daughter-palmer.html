I don’t really know you. Am I supposed to feel like I know you?’” the One Day You’ll Thank Me author exclusively told to Us Weekly in February 2021.</p><p>“Around eight weeks, she started to smile at me, and I started to get some sleep,” the Real World: San Diego alum explained. “I think the no sleep thing really F’s with you. I mean, it messes up your brain chemistry. I think there’s a reason Navy Seals do sleep deprivation as a form of training. When she started sleeping through the night, everything changed.”</p><p>The South Carolina native did experience “some pretty severe baby blues and postpartum anxiety” at the time, which she blamed on “hormones” and called “totally normal.”</p><p>Eubanks said, “You have to be able to separate yourself and on a logic level, know this is normal. This happens to most women. The ones that it happens to that don’t talk about it, they just don’t talk about it because they don’t want to be stigmatized or seem weak. But I think it’s actually more common to feel that way than to not feel [that way.]”</p><p>Three months into raising her daughter, the former Bravo personality<a href=#> decided that she was “done” breast-feeding</a> because it was “making [her] depressed.”</p><p>Eubanks told Us, “I started thinking to myself, having a happy mentally sane mother is ultimately more important than her getting breast milk. I never even drank breast milk and I’m totally fine. … Formula is probably just as good.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She and husband <strong>Jason Wimberly</strong> don’t see themselves having more kids, and Palmer tells her mom that she wants to be “the only baby” in the family. “Praise Jesus,” Eubanks gushed.</p><p>Keep scrolling to see the real estate agent’s cutest pictures with Palmer over the years, from boat rides to snowy selfies.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNkwLDB06Gcq6ZdmLWivsysZJyZnZq%2ForqMnqybmZ6gwG68yJyqZq%2BZqbVusMCunqGslad6sa3LppyrZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./miranda-lambert-accused-of-flipping-plates-on-diners-in-911-call.html><span>←</span><span>Miranda Lambert Accused of Flipping Plates on Diners in 911 Call</span></a>
