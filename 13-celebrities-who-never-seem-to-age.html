Who can blame them? It’s part of their job. Regardless of how much money they spend age is going to catch up to you at some point… or is it?</p><p>There are some celebrities that are defying the laws of age without getting any surgery.&nbsp; It’s hard to gauge which celebrities have had work done and who hasn’t, but we tried our best to leave out the plastic surgery candidates for this list.&nbsp; There are two celebrities in particular on this list that really make you do a double take. It’s absolutely amazing how they don’t seem to age.</p><p>While there are tons of celebs out there that look young for their age, we selected 12 that really never seem to age.</p><p>Image via Jason Merritt/Getty Images</p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/A125.jpg alt="83rd Annual Academy Awards - Arrivals" width=620 height=401 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><strong>Halle Berry</strong></p><p>Age: 47 – Is Halle Berry not the youngest 47-year old on the planet? Halle has been rumored to have had plastic surgery, but a nose job isn’t necessarily going to keep you looking young is it? Having first hit the big screen over 20-years ago, it’s quite incredible to see her at age 47 still looking like she did ten years ago.</p><p>Image via John Shearer/Getty Images</p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/A215.jpg alt="Teen Choice Awards 2012 - Show" width=620 height=466 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><strong>Gwen Stefani</strong></p><p>Age: 44 – Gwen Stefani being 44-years old with children and looking like she did twenty-years ago is absolutely mind-boggling to me. ‘No Doubt’ hit the scene in 1992 and if you look at pictures of her then and pictures of her now, it’s one of the 7 Wonders of the World. For those of you with time, I suggest you Google pictures of Stefani now and then. It’s really jaw-dropping. As far as we know, she hasn’t had any plastic surgery. She’s been able to maintain that athletic figure for over twenty years. Incredible.</p><p>Image via Kevin Winter/Getty Images</p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/A310.jpg alt='"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey" New York Premiere Benefiting AFI - Inside Arrivals' width=620 height=395 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><strong>Liv Tyler</strong></p><p>Age: 36 – Liv Tyler is just naturally beautiful so it seems almost easy for her to ‘not age’. She has incredible skin, and she’s just angelic for lack of a better term. Liv is one of those celebrities who makes you feel old because we all remember her in Aerosmith’s ‘Crazy’ music video. Yes, she looked like the teen she was when it came out in 1993, but that was 21-years ago. 21 years. Look at her now. Amazing.</p><p>Image via Michael Loccisano/Getty Images</p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/A46.jpg alt='Elijah Wood Visits "Late Night With Jimmy Fallon"' width=620 height=411 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><strong>Elijah Wood</strong></p><p>Age: 32 – Let’s be honest: Elijah Wood is growing that facial hair because if he doesn’t he’s going to look 19. Elijah is one of my favorites because he literally could play a kid in high school at age 32 and it would be flawless. You also have to remember that he was on set for ‘Lord of the Rings’ for a few years and almost looked younger by the end of it all. Google a photo of one of the ‘Lord of the Rings’ premieres and ‘The Hobbit’ premiere we’re talking several years and he looks the EXACT same (minus the facial hair – see we told you he had to do it).</p><p>Image via Jason Kempin/Getty Images</p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/A54.jpg alt='"Just Go With It" New York Premiere - Outside Arrivals' width=620 height=442 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><strong>Jennifer Aniston</strong></p><p>Age: 44 – Say what you want about Jennifer Aniston, but for a 44-year old woman she looks incredible. She’s been through a roller-coaster ride in the media the past 10-plus years, but what’s been overlooked is the fact she’s looked great (and the same) for those ten years. What’s amazing is you can imagine the amount of stress she’s been under with failed relationships and tabloid rumors, yet she still looks amazing. Regardless of the little work she’s had done, you could photoshop Brad Pitt in this picture and date it 2002 and you wouldn’t really know the difference.</p><p>Image via Jemal Countess/Getty Images</p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/A65.jpg alt="Little White Lies - Premiere: The 5th International Rome Film Festival" width=620 height=405 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><strong>Eva Mendes</strong></p><p>Age: 39 – I have a really hard time believing that Mendes is pushing 40-years old. Like Liv Tyler, she’s just naturally gorgeous with great skin. Mendes didn’t really break into the mainstream until her late 20s but you could easily swap her out then for now and you wouldn’t know the difference. Covergirl can give her a long-term contract because she doesn’t seem to age one bit, nor does her skin seem to pick up any flaws.</p><p>Image via Ernesto Ruscio/Getty Images</p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/A74.jpg alt="2012 Winter TCA Tour - Day 5" width=620 height=429 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><strong>Jennifer Lopez</strong></p><p>Age: 44 – J. Lo is really a no-brainer to put on this list. She’s 44-years old. Her real breakthrough came in the mid-90s so we’ve been looking at Lopez for 20 years. I don’t see much difference do you? She has a little bit of the magic of Gwen Stefani and Eva Mendes all mixed into one. The only difference I will say for her is when she was younger she looked&nbsp; A LOT younger. So while she doesn’t seem to age there is more of a noticeable difference between her in her twenties and now than the other celebs on the list.</p><p>Image via Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images</p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/A84.jpg alt="2013 Summer TCA Tour - Day 3" width=620 height=453 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><strong>Joseph Gordon-Levitt</strong></p><p>Age: 32 – Gordon-Levitt got the nod when I was looking through celebrities to put on the list and guessed his age to be in the mid-20’s. In retrospect it was a poor guess because he’s been around for what seems like forever, but I did undershoot him. After a little more research I decided to give him a go because he does look like the same actor that we were seeing 5-7-years ago. He has a little bit of that Elijah Wood youthful look, but I expect him to maintain over the next 8-years.</p><p>Image via Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images</p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/A92.jpg alt="The Lone Ranger - UK Premiere - Red Carpet Arrivals" width=620 height=420 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><strong>Johnny Depp</strong></p><p>Age: 50 – Johnny Depp is the ageless wonder. Yeah, he dies his hair, but 50-years old? That’s a joke right. Especially when you think about him in the ‘Pirates of the Caribbean’ garb. Considering Depp made it big on ’21 Jump Street’ 27-years ago it’s quite incredible to see him now. He certainly looks older than he did then, but NOT 27-years older. The fact that he has a different look about him helps his cause, but it’s amazing to see him in films today where he’s made to look younger. He could pass as a 30-year old.</p><p>Image via Eamonn M. McCormack/Getty Images</p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/A103.jpg alt="18th Annual Elton John AIDS Foundation Academy Award Party ? Red Carpet" width=620 height=455 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><strong>Stacey Dash</strong></p><p>Age: 46 – Stacey Dash is 46-years old and still looks like she could play her role in ‘Clueless’ today. That movie came out 18 years ago and how good does Dash look? She’s not as well-known as the other celebrities on this list and she certainly doesn’t get as much of the spotlight, but I had no choice to put her on. When I saw a photo of her and saw she was 46(!!!!) I couldn’t believe it. She’s right there with Gwen Stefani as jaw-dropping. She’s 46!!</p><p>Image via Larry Busacca/Getty Images</p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/A1110.jpg alt="BAFTA Los Angeles 2011 Britannia Awards - Red Carpet" width=620 height=395 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><strong>Morgan Freeman</strong></p><p>Age: 76 – Is it me or has Morgan Freeman been the same guy for the past 20 years? Ok, maybe his hair is a little grayer, but the guy is 76-years old. I think about some of the roles he did in the late 90’s and early part of this century and I say to myself that’s the same guy I’m seeing today. The exact same! It’s like he’s been in a holding pattern when it comes to age for the past 10 years. Amazing for a 76-year old guy.</p><p>Image via Frazer Harrison/Getty Images For BAFTA Los Angeles</p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/A126.jpg alt='"Killing Kennedy" Los Angeles Premiere' width=620 height=419 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><strong>Rob Lowe</strong></p><p>Age: 49 – Rob Lowe might be my least creative of the bunch. I thought about doing Cate Blanchett, but she’s 44 and Lowe is pushing 50 years old. The conflict I have with Lowe is he dyes his hair to death and may have had a little cleanup surgery. Either way, He’s 50 and you can see a tight connection to the Rob Lowe we were seeing close to 20-years ago.</p><p>Image via Michael Kovac/Getty Images for National Geographic Channel</p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/cruise.jpg alt="Ben Stiller Hand/Footprint Ceremony At TCL Chinese Theatre" width=594 height=418 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><strong>Tom Cruise</strong></p><p>Age: 51 – I refuse to believe that Tom Cruise is over the age of 50.&nbsp; The guy can STILL play roles of guys in their 20s.&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s even harder to believe he’s been on the silver screen for over 30 years now.&nbsp; Yes, 30 years.&nbsp; That’s 11 years older than Justin Bieber.</p><p>Photo by Michael Tran/FilmMagic</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGhobGWTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2LEqbuMp5yvnaJiwKaxzGarqGWRnLJw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./10-things-you-didnt-know-about-jon-michael-ecker-html.html><span>←</span><span>10 Things You Didnt Know about Jon-Michael Ecker</span></a>
