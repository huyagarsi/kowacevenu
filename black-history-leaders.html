While a landmark achievement in its own right, the legislation would not have been possible had it not been for the decades of backbreaking work on behalf of civil rights activists around the country.</p><p>We take some extra time each February to commemorate those who have fought for civil and economic equality in the U.S. and around the world, but for the most part the same people tend to come up in coverage: namely Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks, and Malcolm X. Here are some black leaders from history whose names are not as recognizable to many, but should be:</p><h2>Black Leaders You Didn’t Learn About: Robert Smalls</h2><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-43118 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/black-history-robertsmalls-young.jpg alt="Robert Smalls" width=900 height=506 sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-43118 class=wp-caption-text><a href=#>PBS</a></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Robert Smalls</a> (1839-1915) was an enslaved African American assigned to steer the Confederate transport ship CSS Planter during the American Civil War. On May 13th, 1862–and while the ship’s three white officers were spending the night ashore–Smalls dressed as a Captain (along with most other enslaved crewmen) and sailed the Planter out of the Southern wharf.</p><p>Smalls then sailed the ship to another nearby wharf, where he retrieved his own family–along with the families of the other crew members–before sailing the ship past Fort Sumter and surrendering it, its cannons, and the Confederate code books to the Union-controlled United States Navy.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-43117 alt="Black Leaders From American History" width=900 height=643 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/black-history-robert-smalls.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-43117 class=wp-caption-text><a href=#>Biography</a></p><p>It was Robert Smalls’ heroics that convinced President Lincoln to accept African-American soldiers into the Union Army. Smalls would go on to become a ship’s pilot and sea captain for the Union forces, and eventually a member of the United States House of Representatives for the state of South Carolina. When Smalls left office in 1887, he would be the last Republican to represent South Carolina’s 5th congressional district until 2010.</p><h2>Harriet Jacobs</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-43126 alt="Harriet Jacobs" width=900 height=1317 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/black-history-harriet-jacobs.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-43126 class=wp-caption-text><a href=#>Pace</a></p><p>Harriet Jacobs (1813-1897) was an African-American author who dedicated her life to social change, becoming an abolitionist speaker and a reformer after escaping slavery. To do that, Jacobs hid in her grandmother’s attic for seven years and then fled on a boat to Philadelphia in 1842.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-43127 alt="Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl" width=900 height=1360 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/black-history-harriet-book.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-43127 class=wp-caption-text><a href=#>Boston Literary History</a></p><p>In 1861 and under the pseudonym of Linda Brent, Jacobs published her lone work, <a href=# rel=noopener>Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl</a>, which was one of the first narrative autobiographies about the sexual harassment and abuse of female slaves and their struggle for freedom. Jacobs had to change the names of everyone in the book to protect herself and those that she loved.</p><h2>Claudette Colvin</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-43119 alt="Claudette Colvin" width=900 height=506 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/black-history-claudettecolvin-young.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-43119 class=wp-caption-text><a href=#>Taking On The Giant</a></p><p>Claudette Colvin (1939-current) is a civil rights activist from Montgomery, Alabama. On March 2nd, 1955 (a full nine months before the Rosa Parks incident), Colvin refused to give up her bus seat to a white passenger. She was arrested and became one of four plaintiffs in Browder v. Gayle, which ruled that Montgomery’s segregated bus system was unconstitutional.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-43120 alt="Black Civil Rights Leaders Claudette Colvin" width=900 height=900 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/black-history-claudette-colvin.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-43120 class=wp-caption-text><a href=#>biography</a></p><p>At only 15 years old, Claudette Colvin was told by the city bus driver to give up her seat to a white woman – to which she responded, “It’s my constitutional right to sit here as much as that lady. I paid my fare, it’s my constitutional right.” Colvin would later tell Newsweek that she “felt like Sojourner Truth was pushing down on one shoulder and Harriet Tubman was pushing down on the other—saying, ‘Sit down girl!’ I was glued to my seat.”</p><p>Colvin’s bravery would be a catalyst for many future examples of rightly public disobedience, including the famous ride of Rosa Parks.</p><h2>Dorothy Height</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-43121 alt="History Of Black Leaders" width=900 height=1151 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/black-history-dorothyheight-young.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-43121 class=wp-caption-text><a href=#>African American Art Store Blog</a></p><p>Many make the mistake of thinking that the acquisition of civil rights alone will ensure equality for all. But as history has shown us, gender inequalities persist even after societies make gains in civil rights. Dorothy Height (1912-2010) recognized this, and thus focused on advancing African-American women in the fight for equal voter’s rights, access to education, and employment, serving as the President of the National Council of Negro Women for forty years.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-43129 alt="Dorothy Height" width=900 height=506 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/black-history-dorothy-height.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-43129 class=wp-caption-text><a href=#>BET</a></p><p>Height also worked as an advisor to various United States presidents, encouraging President Dwight D. Eisenhower to desegregate schools, and President Lyndon B. Johnson to appoint African-American women to positions in government. In 1994, she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and posthumously received the Congressional Gold Medal in 2004.</p><h2>John Lewis</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-43122 alt="John Lewis" width=900 height=584 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/black-history-johnlewis-young.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-43122 class=wp-caption-text><a href=#>Here and Now</a></p><p>John Lewis (1940-present) is a Democratic congressman from Georgia’s 5th district.

Now, Lewis serves as Senior Chief Deputy Whip, and is one of the most influential people within the Democratic Party.</p><h2>Hosea Williams</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-43124 alt="Hosea Williams" width=900 height=900 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/black-history-hosea-williams.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-43124 class=wp-caption-text><a href=#>biography</a></p><p>If you’ve seen Selma, you have some understanding of who Hosea Williams (1926-2000) is. If not, we’ll provide you with a brief background. Williams accomplished more in his life than most of us can dream of, working as a civil rights leader, politician, scientist, philanthropist, businessman, and ordained minister. Beyond that, Williams served as one of Dr. Martin Luther King’s right-hand men, regularly helping King galvanize the public into action against social injustice.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-43125 alt="Black Leaders In American History Hosea Williams" width=900 height=675 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/black-history-hosea-speaking.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-43125 class=wp-caption-text><a href=#>Georgia Encyclopedia</a></p><p>Following King’s 1968 death and to commemorate King’s legacy, Williams founded the Hosea Feed the Hungry, a non-profit foundation widely known in Atlanta for providing hot meals, haircuts, clothing, and other services for the needy on Thanksgiving, Christmas, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day and Easter Sunday.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyjuMCcomagmajBsL7YZqOemZSav7Q%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./true-detective-recap-season-2-episode-6-html.html><span>←</span><span>True Detective Recap: The Great Escape</span></a>
