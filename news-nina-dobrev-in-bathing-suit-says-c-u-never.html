But she also plays hard too, posting photos from getaways to far-flung places, often in a swimsuit. "<span>ill be zooming from here today, and forever. </span><span>c u never," she just captioned a new post from Canaves Oia, Luxury Resorts and Villas, Santorini, in sun-dappled Greece. </span>How does she stay so fit? Read on to see 5 ways Nina Dobrev stays in shape and the photos that prove they work—and to get beach-ready yourself, don't miss these essential </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><span>30 Best-Ever Celebrity Bathing Suit Photos!</span></a></p><p><span>Her current work has led her to consistency, allowing her to stick to a fairly regular workout and diet regime. It's "the most consistent that I've had so far in my career," she says about her current schedule. "I just love working out." "<span>Aerobic exercise can help improve your heart health and endurance and aid in weight loss. High-intensity interval training is generally safe and effective for most people and can take less time. In high-intensity interval training, you alternate exercising at high levels of intensity and exercising at a less intense level for short periods of time. Even activities such as walking at higher intensities count," says the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Mayo Clinic</a>.</span></span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/GettyImages-1368683751.jpg><p><span>After stating that she actually does love working out, it shouldn't be shocking that Nina has chiseled abs and a fit figure. She's honest that at this point in her life is the first time that she has visible abs and said, "I'm getting older and more conscious of what I eat and how I eat it and what I do," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/GettyImages-1368718026.jpg><p><span>She likes to call her workout routine a "workout cocktail" because she's always switching things up. She likes to involve a mix of weight training, boxing, group classes, running, yoga, or whatever she feels like depending on her mood that day. "Doing something different has been the most fun, and I've seen the most benefit because you shock your system," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she said</span></a><span>.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/GettyImages-1359409308.jpg><p><span>No matter what, Nina makes time to eat enough each day to keep her metabolism going. "I feel healthier," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "You're happier when your body is full, your brain functions better, and you're a nicer person. I would get hangry, I think, because I was so busy running around that I wasn't the best version of myself."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/GettyImages-1329670980.jpg><p><span>Whether it's through a workout like walking her dog, a piping hot shower, or a steam room at the gym, she makes sure to sweat everyday in some way. "I need to sweat every single day somehow, even if it's just in the steam room," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "Some days are better than others, I'll be honest with you. Some days, Maverick gets a shorter walk than she probably deserves, if I'm running late or don't have it together or press the snooze button 18 times too many." </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>According to the Mayo Clinic</span></a><span>, "emerging evidence suggests that sauna bathing has several health benefits, which include reduction in the risk of vascular diseases such as high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease (CVD), stroke, and neurocognitive diseases; nonvascular conditions such as pulmonary diseases including common flu; mortality; treatment of specific skin conditions; as well as pain in conditions such as rheumatic diseases and headache."</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxkp6Gelnqlu8GrnK9lmaN6o63ToaCnn12owqrAjKyYsqtdmHq2ec2erZ6qXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./10125360-nba-rumors-james-borrego-to-be-considered-by-pistons-amid-lakers-cavs-hc-buzz.html><span>←</span><span>NBA Rumors: James Borrego to Be Considered by Pistons amid Lakers, Cavs HC Buzz | News, Scores, High</span></a>
