The Dachshund's long body and extremely short legs mean they're likely to develop Intervertebral Disc Disease (IVDD), limiting their ability to walk.</p><p><strong>MORE: <a href=# rel>5 most affectionate dog breeds for emotional support</a></strong></p><p>According to the BVA, research shows that the risk of IVDD in Dachshunds is 10-12 times higher than other dog breeds, with at least one-fifth of all Dachshunds showing clinical signs in their life. Symptoms usually begin between 5-7 years old.</p><p class=GallerylistItemIndex_g1lcdhm8><span class=GallerylistItemIndexCurrent_g16bk40d>2</span><span class=GallerylistItemIndexTotal_gkchwpf>/6</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1f90ed8add96-great-dane-z.jpg><h2 class="GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g hm-heading">Great Dane</h2><p dir=ltr>These gentle giants are typically loved for their calm and loving nature to match their significant size. Due to the height, weight and mass of Great Danes, however, this breed can be prone to a number of genetic health conditions to be wary of.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>Hip dysplasia can be common in Great Danes that are overweight, while latest research suggests Hypertrophic Osteodystrophy (an inflammatory bone disease) is increasingly common in large breed puppies.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>Care should also be taken when feeding and exercising Great Danes, which are prone to Gastric Torsion, a painful and life-threatening condition where the stomach twists on itself. This breed should ideally be fed multiple smaller meals rather than one large one - and at least half an hour should be given before any exercise.&nbsp;</p><p class=GallerylistItemIndex_g1lcdhm8><span class=GallerylistItemIndexCurrent_g16bk40d>3</span><span class=GallerylistItemIndexTotal_gkchwpf>/6</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c329079680d6-pug.jpg><h2 class="GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g hm-heading">Pug</h2><p>Pugs have been selectively bred with extremely short and flat faces, which can lead to extreme difficulty breathing, heat stroke and fainting. Brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome (BOAS) was the disorder with the highest risk in Pugs, with the breed almost 54 times more likely to have the condition.</p><p>The RSPCA have also raised awareness of the Pug's large prominent eyes and nose folds, which means they are at much higher risk of eye infections and ulcers around the eyes during their lifetime.</p><p class=GallerylistItemIndex_g1lcdhm8><span class=GallerylistItemIndexCurrent_g16bk40d>4</span><span class=GallerylistItemIndexTotal_gkchwpf>/6</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9ab0db249b95-german-shepherd-z.jpg><h2 class="GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g hm-heading">German Shepherd</h2><p>Larger breeds, like the German Shepherd, are typically bred to be heavy and strong.
