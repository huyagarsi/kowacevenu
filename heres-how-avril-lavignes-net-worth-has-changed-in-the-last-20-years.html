When she first launched onto the music scene with her sullen demeanor and fashionably indifferent attitude, Lavigne was able to tap into a teen angst unique to the new millennium. For hordes of teenagers the world over, and particularly for young girls trying to figure out their place in a male-dominated society, Lavigne was a feminist punk icon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What We Forgot About Avril Lavigne's Relationship With Deryck Whibley</a></span></p><p>Of course, she has gone through many changes - both musical and aesthetic - in the past 20 years. Her shift towards a more girly, pop-oriented persona angered some fans, but she also garnered tons more followers by becoming assessible to mainstream sensibilities. Accordingly, the 36-year-old Canadian songstress has seen her net worth rocket in the process. Here's how Avril Lavigne's net worth has changed in the last 20 years.</p><h2 id=she-was-already-a-millionaire-by-the-age-of-15><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>She Was Already A Millionaire By The Age Of 15</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2000, a then unknown 15-year-old Avril Lavigne didn't realize that she was soon going to become a multimillionaire. Her dad had nurtured her musical talents and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">bought her various instruments</a>, including a drum kit and several guitars, which certainly paid off when she was approached by Arista Records. The label signed the teen and offered her a deal worth a staggering $1.25 million and an extra $900,000 as an advance.</p><h2 id=she-made-25-million-from-let-go><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>She Made $25 Million From 'Let Go'</span></h2><p>Two years later, she released her debut album, Let Go. With its&nbsp;angsty&nbsp;pop-punk anthems and Lavigne's distinctive <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">skater girl image</a>, the album was a hit. It sold 16 million copies worldwide and went platinum. Her profits from the album are estimated to be around $25 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=by-2004-she-was-earning-over-14-million><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>By 2004, She Was&nbsp;Earning&nbsp;Over $14 Million</span></h2><p>Two years after her debut, Avril Lavigne released her second album, Under My Skin. Another hit, the album sold $10 million copies the world over. Her estimated earnings from the album are believed to be around $14.8 million, according to The Richest.</p><h2 id=her-tours-saw-her-rake-in-more-cash><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Her Tours Saw Her Rake In More Cash</span></h2><p>In the fall of 2004, Lavigne embarked on a world tour, the Bonez Tour, to promote&nbsp;Under My Skin.&nbsp;The&nbsp;expedition&nbsp;enabled&nbsp;her to jet across both North and South America, Europe, Asia, and Africa. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pollstar</a>, the tours saw her earning $5 million. Not bad at all for a 19-year-old.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=in-2007-she-made-the-forbes-top-20-earners-under-25-list><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>In 2007,&nbsp;She Made The Forbes "Top 20 Earners Under 25" List</span></h2><p>Following the release of her third album, The Best Damn Thing, Lavigne was flying high in 2007. However, the record did divide both fans and critics due to the singer's transition from pop-punk to more traditional bubblegum pop.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Everything Christina Milian Has Done Since The Early 2000s</a></span></p><p>The album spawned Lavigne's most successful&nbsp;single to date, the upbeat and poppy "Girlfriend", which reached number one on the Billboard 100. Featuring on the Forbes "Top 20 Under 25" list, the publication put her net worth at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$12 million</a>&nbsp;at the time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-best-damn-world-tour-saw-her-earning-millions><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>"The Best Damn World Tour" Saw Her Earning Millions</span></h2><p>Embarking on&nbsp;a world tour for The Best Damn Thing in 2008, Lavigne sparked the ire of some critics due to the hefty cost of tickets. The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Times Colonist</a>&nbsp;published a scathing review that took aim at the ticket prices: "...the so-billed Best Damn Tour wasn't even the Somewhat OK Damn Tour; it was just plain disappointing. And with tickets in the range of $60, the 75-miniute concert clocked in just shy of one dollar per minute."</p><p>Despite the negative reviews, Lavigne made a small fortune from the tour: an average of $1 million was grossed per concert.</p><h2 id=her-earnings-declined-slightly-with-the-release-of-goodbye-lullaby><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Her Earnings Declined Slightly With The Release Of 'Goodbye Lullaby'</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although it was a certified Gold record by 2018, Avril Lavigne's fourth album, Goodbye Lullaby, wasn't her most successful upon its release in 2008. With mixed reviews from critics, the album sold 3.5 million copies worldwide, which is just a fraction of what her first 2 albums sold. Accordingly, she made around $2.3 million from the album, which is undoubtedly still an impressive figure for a then 23-year-old.</p><h2 id=by-2019-she-was-filthy-rich><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>By 2019 She Was Filthy Rich</span></h2><p>By the time her fifth, self-titled album&nbsp;was released in 2013, Avril Lavigne was extraordinarily rich. Her net worth in 2013 was estimated to be over $10 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But with the release of Head Above Water in 2019, her bank balance sky rocketed. At the time, her net worth was believed to be around $45 million according to Celebrity Net Worth.</p><h2 id=her-annual-income-is-colossal><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Her Annual Income Is Colossal</span></h2><p>Avril Lavigne's ever expanding net worth lies in her enormous annual salary. She rakes in around $10 million a year, which is likely comprised of royalties, record sales, tours, and endorsements.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrities Who Finally Joined TikTok In 2021</a></span></p><p>For instance, she has released a number of fragrances for multinational corporation Procter & Gamble. She also has her own clothing line, Abbey Dawn, and collaborated with Disney to release an Alice in Wonderland-style drop.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=this-is-her-jaw-dropping-net-worth-now><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>This Is Her Jaw-Dropping Net Worth Now</span></h2><p>In the space of just 2 years, Avril Lavigne has seen her net worth increase from $45 million to a jaw-dropping $60 million according to her updated&nbsp;Celebrity Net Worth profile. Aged just 36, that is a phenomenal amount for the young musician.</p><p>With a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">new album</a> rumored to be in the works, reportedly featuring Willow Smith and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Machine Gun Kelly</a>, Lavigne is set to become even richer.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans Can't Keep Calm As Avril Lavigne And Willow Are Spotted Filming A New Music Video</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHqpu9ZmmK%2BqmaF6ra3Vop6nnaNiu6bAjLCmq6yYYrWiv4ycn5qml5qxbrXNZquhnV2hrrTAjGtnZrGVlr%2B0ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./revivify-where-did-that-come-from-482052.html><span>←</span><span>D&amp;amp;D 5E - Revivify - where did that come from?!?</span></a>
