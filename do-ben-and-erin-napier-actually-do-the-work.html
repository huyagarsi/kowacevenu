Instead, he largely spends his time honing his furniture-making skills and is considered a woodworker — which is evident in just about every episode of Home Town.</strong></p><p>As well, Is Home Town staged?</p><p>It starred funnyman, Tim Allen, and yes, it was what you might call “fake” and that’s because it was a sitcom. It was scripted, had professional actors, and was meant to simply entertain viewing audiences and make them laugh.</p><p>Then What does Ben Napier do for a living?</p><p>Instead, he’s a woodworker who makes furniture. Just take a look at his Instagram bio, where he notes that along with his HGTV show, he spends his time focusing on “history-inspired woodworking from Laurel, MS.” He’s also the star of “Home Town: Ben’s Workshop,” which sees him spending time with his wood-related craft.</p><p>Therefore, How many children do Erin and Ben Napier have? How many children do Ben and Erin have? Ben and Erin have two children, including daughter Mae and four-year-old girl Helen. They welcomed Mae into the world on May 28 2021, who Erin is pregnant with during the latest Home Town episodes.</p><p>Did Ben from Home Town lose weight? The Home Town star revamped his diet and lifestyle, all while shooting the show, and has lost 55 lbs. over the last year. Napier, 35, said he did it for his family.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Did_Erin_and_Ben_Napier_have_a_second_baby></span><strong>Did Erin and Ben Napier have a second baby?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Erin Napier and Ben Napier, the stars of HGTV’s Home Town, shared snapshots on Instagram to announce that they welcomed their second child, a baby girl.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Are_Ben_and_Erin_expecting_another_baby></span><strong>Are Ben and Erin expecting another baby?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>No, Erin is not pregnant again, but it is true that she had a baby bump in the recently-aired episodes. The truth is that they technically filmed some Home Town Season 6 episodes during Season 5, while she was pregnant. This means that her second child with Ben was on the way during the new episodes.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Was_Home_Town_Cancelled></span><strong>Was Home Town Cancelled?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Unfortunately, though, “Home Town Takeover” will not be returning for another season any time soon.

Homeowners must decide if they want to work that furniture into their final budget.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_did_Ben_and_Erin_Napier_do_before_Home_Town></span><strong>What did Ben and Erin Napier do before Home Town?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The Couple Had Almost No Experience in Home Renovation Before Starting Home Town. Ben was a former youth minister with a degree in history, and Erin owned a wedding stationery company with a degree in graphic design. The only experience in home renovation the pair had was on their own home in 2012.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Where_does_Erin_Napier_buy_her_clothes></span><strong>Where does Erin Napier buy her clothes?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Love Erin’s style sense on Home Town? Good news: You can actually purchase her clothes! “I’ve donated lots of my clothes from seasons 1-4 of #HGTVHomeTown to @theremnantlaurel, a co-op shop with a purpose, so you can buy my gently worn wardrobe while helping women in need,” she shared on Instagram.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Did_the_Napiers_have_their_baby></span><strong>Did the Napiers have their baby?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Erin Napier shared a new photo of her youngest daughter, Mae, on Instagram, as well as an update on how the baby is doing.

At 6’6″ tall, the Laurel, Mississippi-based woodworker towers over his 5’5″ other half, and his large build sometimes seems better suited for a football player than a small-town shop owner.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Does_Ben_from_Home_Town_have_a_brother></span><strong>Does Ben from Home Town have a brother?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ben’s brothers, Sam, Tom and Jesse, have been there for them every step of the way, making cameos on the show and on social media.

So, it’s likely that Ben and Erin receive a similar pay cheque, due to the five-season success of the renovation series.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Are_Ben_and_Erin_Napier_both_from_Laurel_Mississippi></span><strong>Are Ben and Erin Napier both from Laurel Mississippi?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The genesis of their story is the stuff of TV fairy tales.
