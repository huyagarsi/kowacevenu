However, in the light of <a href=# title="Chelsea Clinton Calls Donald Trump ‘The Greatest Scam In American History’ And More!"><strong>Donald Trump</strong></a>’s wild speech about getting his presidential victory stolen in the elections, the host was much more somber.</p><p>In fact, not only did he wear all black to highlight his heartbreak over the POTUS ‘killing democracy,’ Colbert got pretty emotional as well, struggling a lot to keep his tears from falling on camera.</p><p>The segment was shot not too long after Donald Trump delivered a speech filled with lies at the White House, where he, very inaccurately declared he won the election but that the democrats stone that victory from him via voter fraud.</p><p>‘We’re taping this a little while after Donald Trump walked into the White House briefing room and tried to poison American democracy. That’s why I’m not sitting down yet, I just don’t feel like it yet. That’s also why I’m dressed for a funeral, because Donald Trump tried really hard to kill something tonight,’ Colbert tells his audience, adding that Trump lied for no less than 15 minutes, saying all kinds of ’nonsensical stuff about illegal vote dumps and corrupt election officials and secret Democrat counting cabals.’</p><p></p><p>While he admitted to expecting him to do something like this, the host stressed that he never thought it would hurt as much as it did, at which point he got really emotional.</p><p>‘I didn’t expect this to break my heart. For him to cast a dark shadow on our most sacred right from the briefing room in the White House, our house, not his. That is devastating. This is heartbreaking for the same reason that I didn’t want him to get COVID, certainly why I want him to survive because he is the President of the United States. That office means something and that office should have some shred of decency.’</p><p>He went on to call for all Republicans to speak up against Trump’s claims, insisting that this is the time they finally choose – Donald Trump or the American people!</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>For more on what Stephen Colbert had to say, check out the video above!</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGejqbKxtMSnZJynnJeys8CMoJytq12aurDAyKilmqRdlrO1sdFmm6imkaGxbsDRrqSpq12jvK%2B%2FxKeqopuRoXq0vMSemqFlo5bGtHnHnmStqpmasW7AzmaioqScYrGmuc6cqZqbqWKur7CMpqarnV1pgnR8mGxm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./new-aew-fight-forever-gameplay-shows-off-orange-cassidys-signature-gesture.html><span>←</span><span>New AEW Fight Forever Gameplay Shows Off Orange Cassidys Signature Gesture</span></a>
