Introduction WhistlinDiesel’s YouTube channel is practically a garage on steroids.
He’s modified an F350 with reaper wheels—if you don’t know what they are, you can check them out right here—mulched a truck, and dropped a Toyota Hilux from 10,000 feet.
He’s come under fire multiple times for his wasteful, consumerist behavior—which is probably a fair call, when you’re destroying cars worth upwards of $50,000.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>African river that starts at Lake Victoria</h2><time>Jun 23, 2024</time>
