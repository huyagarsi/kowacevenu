<a href=../../what-is-the-difference-between-cox-1-and-cox-2-inhibitors.html></a>
The key difference between COX 1 and COX 2 inhibitors is that COX 1 inhibitor is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug that inhibits cyclooxygenase-1 enzyme expressed constitutively in most tissues while COX 2 inhibitor is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug that inhibits cyclooxygenase-2 enzyme expressed in areas of inflammation.
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) usually provide anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic effects. They are used in the treatment of a variety of diseases. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs inhibit a particular rate-limiting enzyme called cyclooxygenase (COX) involved in the production of prostaglandins.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Why Hollywood Won't Cast Christine Taylor Anymore</h2><time>Jul 9, 2024</time>
