Pysanka nearly died out when Ukraine fell under the sway of <a href=#>the Soviet Union</a>, as it was seen to be a religious tradition. More than all others, though, geometric figures are perhaps the most common kind of pysanka design, and they're believed to date all the way back to Paleolithic cultures in the Ukrainian region.</p><p>Geometric pysanky egg designs are typically lines, squares, or some other kind of shape. Triangles symbolize rain, an important portent for good harvest, while dots represent seeds, and quadrilaterals stand in for plowed fields. These are just a few of the many examples of the part geometry plays in pysanka. Another important geometric motif is the berehynia, a curly-shaped goddess symbol used as a harvest blessing, among other purposes. There are also eternity bands, representing immortality, as well as water and waves used for rain blessings, as <a href=#>Ukrainian People</a> explains.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCEkG5pcG9fqbWmec6roKChnmK8p3nUpKmaoZ6awG61za2popuRqbKtxYydnJynopbBprCMnpisrJWneqazxqxm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./martina-mcbride-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Martina McBride Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</span></a>
