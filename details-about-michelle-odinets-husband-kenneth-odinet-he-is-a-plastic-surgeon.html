<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Details about Michelle Odinets husband Kenneth Odinet He is a plastic surgeon</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Lafayette City Judge Michelle Odinet allegedly can’t remember racially abusing a burglar who was arrested outside her house. A video of herself enthusiastically using the n-word couldn’t refresh her memory as she ‘was given a sedative at the time of the video.’&nbsp;“I have zero recollection of the video and the disturbing language used during it,”&nbsp;Michelle told&nbsp;The Current.</p><p>Michelle acknowledged that the video was recorded in her home and apologized for it. Dane Ciolino, Michelle’s attorney, later told&nbsp;CBS News&nbsp;that one of the voices in the video belonged to her.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s unclear who else used a racial slur in the video, but rumor suggests that the voices belong to Michelle’s family.&nbsp;</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=michelle-denied-that-she-and-her-husband-kenneth-odinet-jr-are-racist></span>Michelle denied that she and her husband, Kenneth Odinet Jr., are racist<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Michelle and her husband, Kenneth Odinet, have been married for nearly three decades. They have four children: Caroline, Libby, Elli, and Kenny.&nbsp;</p><p>The vile video recorded at Michelle and Kenneth’s house allegedly involves family members. So far, only Michelle has accepted that her voice is in the video.</p><p>A female voice repeatedly used the n-word and referred to the black man as a ‘roach.’ A male voice, saying that ‘mom’ was yelling the n-word, contributed to the seemingly funny conversation.&nbsp;</p><p>Is one of the male voices of Michelle’s son or husband? The names Ken and Kenny surface twice in the video, referring to someone who was ‘just standing there.’&nbsp;</p><p>The Odinet household has two potential ‘Kens’: Michelle’s husband, Kenneth Odinet, or her son, Kenny.</p><p>At the moment, we can’t confirm the identity of ‘Ken’ or ‘Kenny’ in the video.&nbsp;</p><p>Michelle has, however, insisted that she and her husband are not racist. She told&nbsp;The Current:</p><p>“Anyone who knows me and my husband knows this is contrary to the way we live our lives. I am deeply sorry and ask for your forgiveness and understanding as my family and I deal with the emotional aftermath of this armed burglary.”</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=kenneth-odinet-is-a-plastic-surgeon-and-coroner-of-lafayette-parish></span>Kenneth Odinet is a plastic surgeon and coroner of Lafayette Parish<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Kenneth Odinet is a South Louisiana native who received his medical degree from Louisiana State University in the late 80s. In the 90s, he completed residencies in plastic surgery and head and neck surgery. Odinet later earned a dental degree from LSU.</p><p>Dr. Odinet runs a medical practice named Odinet Plastic Surgery and Skincare. He is the lead surgeon in an institution that offers a wide variety of procedures. His bio on the website reads:</p><p>“Dr. Odinet’s combined advanced training makes him uniquely qualified to ensure that your plastic surgery options function as well as they look. Currently, he is the only plastic surgeon in Acadiana board certified in ear, nose, and throat surgery, and plastic and reconstructive surgery. With his combined background in dentistry and plastic surgery, Dr. Odinet can offer you a wide range of plastic and reconstructive surgery options.”</p><p>Dr. Kenneth Odiner is also the Lafayette Parish Coroner.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJyVqa6quNJmmJunpal6rrXCoZylpJVivKW1zZ6rrGWYqsCjrc2dZKSdnqOytbSMqJuippWpeqmxjKKqZpldpbmiv9Oimmarpae0prvNaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./noah-beck-tik-tok-height-age-bio-wiki-net-worth-girlfriend.html><span>←</span><span>Noah Beck (Tik Tok) Height, Age, Bio, Wiki, Net Worth &amp;amp; Girlfriend</span></a>
