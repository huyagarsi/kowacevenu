"I have always heard women say you just know when you are pregnant and I totally understand that now. &nbsp;Your body, smell, sensitivity and cravings all change and mine did from day one. I found out shortly after a blood test confirmed the results and called Joe immediately, we were both screaming and so loud with excitement from each end of the phone!"</p><p>Francis isn't concerned about being the father of two girls. "We chose to have girls," he said. "I believe people will finally understand my love, respect and admiration for women. I love girls."</p><p>The couple has happily been telling their friends the big news, especially the ones who are parents themselves.</p><p>"<a href=#><strong>Kourtney</strong></a> [Kardashian] and <a href=#><strong>Scott</strong></a> [Disick] were the first in the Kardashian family we told and they have already given us so much amazing advice," Francis told <strong>Us</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Wilson adds, "<a href=#><strong>Mario</strong></a> and <strong>Courtney Lopez</strong> took us baby shopping at Bel Bambini, and Mario is now coaching Joe on fatherhood!"</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The future parents are planning ahead on everything, even the girls' room! Francis tells <strong>Us</strong>, "We're hoping for some advice from our good friend, designer Martyn Lawrence Bullard!"</p><p>And when it comes to their children's future godparents, they already have potential candidate. Could a member of the Kardashian-Jenner clan be in the running?</p><p>"Perhaps someone we all may know… perhaps not?" Francis teased to Us in March.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKGonV2bv6K6wqKqZp%2BZp7mnvsiepZ1lkZevpsWMsKClq5%2BjerG%2BxKClmqakYsG4tc1mnqKqnKh6c3yQbWhpbA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jerome-bettis-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Jerome Bettis Net Worth Phone Number, House Address, Wiki</span></a>
