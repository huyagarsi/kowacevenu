The categories should be mixed, allowing the judges to have, one boy, one girl, one group, and one over in their category.</p><p><strong>THEME WEEKS:</strong></p><p>After years of big band week, number 1’s week, it has not got boring and dated. So it is time to axe the theme’s and let the judges choose any song, from any genre that fits their singer.</p><p><strong>SING OFF:</strong></p><p>Rather than the judges choosing out of the bottom two, the contestants should sing again, and the phone lines should be opened for ten minuets, to allow the public to vote through their favourite.</p><p><strong>WILDCARDS:</strong></p><p>Axe the wildcards, the judges should only pick three contestants each, to take through to the live shows.</p><p><strong>The X Factor is due to return to our screens late next month</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51ks7DB0WadqKqdlsFur8eapaCdo2LBqbGMsWSfmZOpvLN50qGmrqSUYrqit8Ro</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./arun-govil-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-551831-html.html><span>←</span><span>Arun Govil Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
