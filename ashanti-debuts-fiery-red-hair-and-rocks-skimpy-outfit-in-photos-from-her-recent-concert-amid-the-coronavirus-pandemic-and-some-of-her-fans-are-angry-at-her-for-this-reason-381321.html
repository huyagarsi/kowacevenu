It was her and JLo killing it. Those were the days. She had hit after hit. She made her mark. During that time, her music made us feel good. It felt like a cool breeze driving in the summertime, saying, “Oh baby, I just wanna love you, baby.” She has hits that will be played until I am old. We love you, Ashanti. Live your best life! 🥰😍😍😍💪🏽. I meant iconic Ashanti ☺️.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B98ZHrGDiiW/</p><p>This supporter shared this joke: “Beautiful queen 🙌🙌 , but 🤔 you wearing the N99 mask wrong 😂Maybe that’s a bedazzled corona mask,lol by the way, I had tickets but didn’t go, not worth it cause of Rona.”</p><p>A critic stated: “Ain’t concerts canceled 🤔Ashanti must have an invisible mask!”</p><p>Another commenter read: “I know it’s all over our news people better run and get tested smh.
