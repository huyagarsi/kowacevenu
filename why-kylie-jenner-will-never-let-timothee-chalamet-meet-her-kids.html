However, the pair broke up not long after their son’s birth. And though break-ups are nothing new in their history, this is the first time Kylie has been linked to someone new – <a href=#>Timothee Chalamet</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Kardashian-Jenners are known for dating musicians and sport stars, so Kylie and Timothee’s pairing seemed random to many people. While some fans were expecting the dating rumors to be debunked quickly, they’ve persisted, and multiple reports say Kylie and Timothee are indeed casually dating.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Kylie Jenner Seemingly Snubs Ex Travis Scott As Both Parents Attend Daughter’s Graduation</a></span></p><p>However, fans shouldn’t expect Timothee to spend time with Kylie’s two children any time soon. The Kylie Cosmetics founder is notoriously protective of her kids. Even though they’re often in the public eye, especially her eldest, 5-year-old daughter Stormi, introducing them to a new significant other is likely too big of a step for her to take right now. Here’s why.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kylie-has-an-on-and-off-history-with-her-children-rsquo-s-father>Kylie Has An On-And-Off History With Her Children’s Father</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/untitled-design-56.jpg><p>Kylie Jenner was first publicly linked to rapper Travis Scott in 2017, before welcoming their daughter, Stormi, the following year. Kylie also gave birth to their son, Aire, in 2022.</p><p>Despite having two children together, Travis and Kylie’s relationship has been on-and-off for years. Most recently, it was reported the pair broke up in September 2023 after spending the holidays apart. "This has happened so many times before, they're known to be on again off again, but always remain friends and great coparents," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a source told Us Weekly at the time</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Fans Just Noticed This Sad Detail About How Kylie And Stormi Interact</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It’s very likely Travis and Kylie have dated other people during one of their break-ups, including their most recent one. In fact, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Travis was spotted partying with multiple women</a> months after their split was announced.</p><p>Kylie has never been publicly linked to anyone during her break-ups with Travis, with the recent exception of Timothee Chalamet. It appears the makeup mogul is moving on, which may signal things are forever over between Kylie and Travis.</p><h2 id=kylie-rsquo-s-romance-with-timothee-may-only-be-a-rebound>Kylie’s Romance With Timothee May Only Be A Rebound</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/head-shot-timothee-chalamet.jpg><p>Neither Kylie nor Timothee have publicly addressed their reported romance. They were first linked in April 2023, with photos showing Kylie’s car at the actor’s house.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources have insisted the couple are only casually dating, though they appear to be very into each other. "Kylie and Timothée are casually seeing each other, but are trying to keep it low-key," a source gushed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Tonight</a>. "They are becoming more comfortable with each other, but Kylie wants to take things day by day and see where it goes,” they continued. “Her family thinks it's great that Kylie is doing her thing and they are supportive."</p><p>So far, Timothee hasn’t been publicly photographed at Kylie’s home or linked to her kids, so he likely hasn’t met them, which is a sign the relationship may only be a rebound.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Muddy Truth About Kylie Jenner's Billionaire Status Today</a></span></p><p>However, the Kardashian-Jenner family are notoriously protective of their kids when it comes to introducing new significant others. Kim Kardashian reportedly had strict rules for Kanye West’s new wife Bianca Censori after their impromptu wedding, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">even requested a meeting with her</a> to establish common ground.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Then again, Kim didn’t hesitate to introduce her four kids to Pete Davidson during their 8-month romance; <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he was seen hanging out with her children</a> on multiple occasions. So, Kylie may not waste much time introducing her kids to Timothee if she sees things going far. But for now, there’s no evidence to suggest that Timothee has been introduce to Stormi and Aire.</p><p>Furthermore, Timothe may need to meet Kylie’s ex Travis Scott before he’s introduced to their kids, and there’s also no evidence to suggest that the two have met. Apparently, Travis is having difficulty adjusting to Kylie’s new romance.</p><p>“Although Travis understands that Kylie is free to date whoever she wants, he’s not exactly ecstatic about the whole situation [with Timothée],” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a source told Us Weekly</a>. “Despite his feelings, Kylie and Travis have both been very mature about their split and are focused on co-parenting in a healthy manner,” the insider went on.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=but-timothee-has-met-the-rest-of-kylie-rsquo-s-family>But Timothee Has Met The Rest Of Kylie’s Family</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/kendallkylie.webp><p>While Timothee may not have met Kylie’s kids yet, he has apparently met some other key family members – her mother Kris Jenner and sister Kendall Jenner. Sources told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly </a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">that the family “absolutely approves”</a> of the romance.</p><p>Knowing the Kardashian-Jenners, getting the family’s approval is a major step if a romance is going to move forward. Travis has had a series of legal troubles in recent years, including <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">lawsuits worth over $10 billion</a> connected to the Astroworld tragedy as well as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">assaulting a DJ and concertgoer</a>. Timothee – an arguably beloved, unproblematic, and successful actor – may be a breath of fresh air for Kylie and her family.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If Timothee does meet Kylie’s kids, then fans can be positive their romance is going in a very serious relationship.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdoMattcRmoZ6mnpq%2FbsPIpaNmppWrsrN5y56rZqyZory1tMSeZJygkaGurrHTZqSenaRitaa%2BjKSgnatf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-good-place-recap-season-3-episode-7-html.html><span>←</span><span>The Good Place Recap: The Parent Trap</span></a>
