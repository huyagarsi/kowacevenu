<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Katie Hopkins Takes Kelly Clarkson Fat-Shaming Comments Even Further</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Too far! British journalist <strong>Katie Hopkins</strong> continued her nasty tirade against <strong><a href=#>Kelly Clarkson</a></strong> on Thursday, March 5.&nbsp;</p><p>After raising eyebrows earlier with her mean-spirited tweets about Clarkson's weight, Hopkins, 40, took it even further in a follow-up interview with Access Hollywood.&nbsp;</p><p>"Jesus, what happened to Kelly Clarkson? Did she eat all of her backing singers?" <a href=#>Hopkins first wrote on Feb. 20</a>. "Look chubsters, Kelly Clarkson had a baby a year ago. That is no longer baby weight. That is carrot cake weight. Get over yourselves."&nbsp;</p><p>Hopkins inspired swift and fierce backlash with her words, getting called out for her fat-shaming criticism.&nbsp;</p><p>"There is no such thing as fat-shaming," Hopkins said with a laugh on Access Hollywood. "There is only skinny-blaming… It doesn't hurt me if I hurt someone's feelings. Ultimately if you put yourself out there, if you're in the media, if you're in the public eye, then you have to accept what comes your way."</p><p>"That's not bullying, that's a great line," she added of her tweets. "Ultimately, Twitter is about finding the fun and Kelly Clarkson does look a bit like she ate her backing singers. I would suggest that when she took eating for two and she decided to eat for 10. If you can't find the fun in that, then more pity on you."</p><p>Clarkson, 32, has long been under a microscope for her weight, which has yo-yoed in the years since she rose to fame as the first-ever winner of American Idol in 2002. The evolution continued this past June with the birth of daughter <strong>River Rose</strong>, her first child with husband <strong>Brandon Blackstock</strong>.</p><p>"Ultimately Kelly Clarkson is a chunky monkey," Hopkins asserted. "We can call it baby weight. We can call it puppy fat. We can call it love handles. We can call it muffin top, any of the nice, soft and cuddly names we give it, but ultimately it's fat. She's fat, she needs to get out, eat less, and move more."</p><p>"I feel it's my responsibility to point out to chubsters that they need to get up off their ass, stop costing me money as a taxpayer, and get out there and run a little bit more," she added on Access Hollywood.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>While Hopkins' original comments went viral, Clarkson did not let the harsh criticism get to her. "Screw 'em," <a href=#>she said on Watch What Happens Live! on Thursday evening</a>. "I've never really pleased everyone. It doesn't matter what I do. If I'm too fat, then when I'm skinny, I'm too clothed, and if I'm not clothed… It's just, you can't ever win."</p><p>"She doesn't know me," <a href=#>Clarkson said of Hopkins earlier in the week</a>. "I'm awesome! It doesn't bother me. It's a free world. Say what you will. I've just never cared what people think. It's more if I'm happy and I'm confident and feeling good, that's always been my thing. And more so now, since having a family — I don't seek out any other acceptance."</p><p>Watch Hopkins defend herself and her words in the video above.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGakmaSesm60zqmioqajYsGit8SsZKSdnKHGbq%2FLmqmkq5%2Bjeqet02aqoZmdnruoecKopKadnqnAbrHVnqVmnqWnwamx0WZpaWlla4Bw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./golden-bachelor-divorce-gerry-and-theresa-split-theories-explained.html><span>←</span><span>Golden Bachelor Divorce: Gerry and Theresa Split Theories Explained</span></a>
