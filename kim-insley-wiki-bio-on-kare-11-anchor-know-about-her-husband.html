Know about Her Husband</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Kim Insley is a very well-known television personality from Minnesota from her affiliation as the morning anchor for the renowned KARE 11 news program. She might very well be one of the most recognized faces from the twin cities as she is the first thing people see when they tune on to the morning news show as she has been for the last 24 years. Learn about Kim’s bio through her wiki and her career of over 20 years.</p><h2>Kim Insley husband & married life</h2><p>Kim Insley despite her stunning 24 ½ years with the KARE TV has rarely brought up her personal life. This just goes unto show her professional side when it comes to journalism. There is not much talk about her husband and children as their personal information is missing even from her bio in her wiki pages. She is blissfully married to her longtime husband Pete and they also have two children together who are both daughters.</p><p>We have scarce information about Kim’s family as well as personal life but you can easily come across them in her social media pages. Her husband Pete, especially features in a lot of pictures of their dates and other romantic husband-wife moments.</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Saturday afternoon date!

However, the KARE 11 morning team celebrated her birthday on TV and on social media revealing to us that her birthday is on June 11. However, we can consider looking over her physical appearance and her sole 24-year career on KARE 11 that she is in her 40s but there is no exact saying as she must maintain her body. She also frequently talks about weight loss topics on Twitter.</p><p>Apart from her work in KARE 11, she has also worked for KOIN-TV and KXTV. She also has 3 more children that are her 2 “very naughty” dogs and a cat.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7jIr5yuqJSWwaZ6wqikaKOZonqqutKlnLJlp564qnnBoqZmp55iuKK%2BxGZoamWRo7Cpu9Fmoqenp2Kuo7vUrWShnaJitba%2FwZqlnWc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./174639-john-cenas-brother-daniel-cena-a-west-newbury-police-sergeant.html><span>←</span><span>John Cena's brother, Daniel Cena, is a West Newbury police sergeant</span></a>
