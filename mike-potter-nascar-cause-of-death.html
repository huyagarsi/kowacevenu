Potter came in 16th place, driving his own No. 76 Chevrolet.</p><p>“Mike Potter was a lifelong friend to our owner, Johnny Davis, and an all-around loving and compassionate soul,” said JD Motorsports.</p><p>“He loved and lived this sport, you could usually find him walking around the infield checking on everyone and making sure they had what they needed. He will be greatly missed by everyone who had the honour of meeting him. ‘A true friend is never truly gone. Their spirit lives on in the memories of those who loved them.’”</p><p>Highlights of his career included qualifying for the 1992 Daytona 500 in the No. 77 Chevrolet, where he finished 30th after retiring due to a fuel pump problem. In the 1993 spring race at Darlington, he made his final Cup Series start for longtime car owner Jimmy Means.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKWZoLJuvM6tq56qXaOutK%2FAq2ScmaWosm67xWabnpmknXw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mike-piazza-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Mike Piazza Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</span></a>
