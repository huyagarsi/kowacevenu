She’s been a great part of the show for so long, but because of certain laws, Sandy’s hands were tied.”</p><p>Speaking to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Decider</a>&nbsp;in August 2020, Hannah said: &nbsp;“It’s wasn’t narcotics. It’s anti-anxiety medication.</p><p>“I think I’ve just been really disappointed because I feel I’m being painted as some sort of drug addict or what have you.</p><p>“Which is just so sad, because there are so many people in the world that suffer from mental illness.”</p><h2>What will happen in Below Deck: Mediterranean season 6?</h2><p>Bravo has teased that the Below Deck Med crew will experience “a serious crisis” before the first charter that will be “a shocking franchise first.”</p><p>They also said that the Lady Michelle yachties will encounter a wedding, a medical emergency, and a major storm all within the course of a single charter season.</p><p>We’ll also see one of Captain Sandy’s biggest blowups ever, which fans may be surprised to see directed at Malia.</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Thesun.co.uk</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnlJ6xbrjEsaBmn5Wpeqe10Z6bZqeeYq%2BmuM6wZJ2dk6B8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bachelor-in-paradise-kiki-morris-age-instagram-boyfriend-wiki.html><span>←</span><span>Bachelor In Paradise: Kiki Morris Age, Instagram, Boyfriend, Wiki</span></a>
