She touched some of your lives personally and some of your lives via her immense life on another platform.”</p><p>Jacquie added that Kyle “loved and lived fiercely.”</p><p>“Nothing makes sense now and we’ll understand more in the next few days,” she wrote. “Be kind to one another please.”</p><p>A cause of death has yet to be released.</p><p>Kyle’s sister <strong>Lindsay Roth</strong> also took to social media to pay tribute, noting that the family doesn’t know what happened yet.</p><p>“As a family we are still processing and deciding how to properly celebrate and honor her life,” she wrote via <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> on Monday. “I know she touched so many people with her humor, intelligence, beauty, gossip activism, athleticism and more – she had so many gifts.”</p><p>Lindsay noted that she was here to “talk and share memories” about Kyle, and promised to notify her followers with any memorial plans.</p><p>“I am so sorry to those learning about this loss right now,” she concluded. “Any prayers thoughts blessings or intentions for this soul’s smooth transition are welcomed.”</p><p>In the comments section of the post, actress <strong>Julia Fox</strong> expressed her condolences. “I know I never met Kyle in real life, but I really felt like I knew her,” Fox, 34, wrote. “I’m so devastated and have been crying ever since the news leaked on TikTok. I really hope she did it suffer and I hope she knew how much she touched our lives. She was a ray of sunshine and I will miss her deeply.”</p><p>Kyle’s cousin <strong>Laura Feibelman</strong> also shared a sweet upload via <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a>, noting that the TikToker is “dearly missed by many.”</p><p>“Full of life, likely the most passionate person I will ever know,” Laura wrote on Monday. “Grateful to have visited her across state lines the past few years & she came out to one of my shows when we took this.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Kyle rose to fame on the social media platform by uploading celebrity gossip videos with her catchphrase, “You want more, I’ll give you more.”</p><p>In her latest post earlier this month, Kyle asked her <a href=# rel=noopener>TikTok</a> followers if they remembered when <strong>JoJo Siwa</strong> and <strong>Tom Sandoval</strong> were “on that reality show together.” (Kyle was referring to the pair’s appearance on <a href=#>Special Forces: World’s Toughest Test</a>, which aired in 2023.)</p><p>Kyle, who wrote via <a href=# rel=noopener>X</a> in July 2021 that she was a colon cancer survivor, previously shared her health woes in an <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> upload. “3 major abdominal surgeries. 1 reconstructive shoulder surgery. Over a dozen broken bones,” she wrote in February. “One torn meniscus. Several car accidents. Even more concussions. Collegiate lacrosse. Soccer at elementary school recess. 3 missing internal organs. BUT LOTS OF BAD ASS F–KING SCARS.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatoZupvKx50q2Yq2WbrrmmecyaqaKrkWK%2FsMDHZpuemZRirrV5km9m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./joanna-zarur.html><span>←</span><span>Joanna Zarur Net Worth 2024, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</span></a>
