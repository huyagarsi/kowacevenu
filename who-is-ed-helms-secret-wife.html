In fact, fans have rarely heard him mention his family life. Interestingly, Helms has also never disclosed the identity of his wife, or their daughter. While this might be a rare occurrence considering how public many actors are, it seems as if Ed Helms prefers to keep things on the down-low.</p><p><strong>Updated on March 6, 2023:</strong> Ed Helms is no doubt a familiar face on both the big and small screen after appearing in over 80 productions throughout the course of two decades. Despite his time in the spotlight, he continues to keep his private life close to his chest. As of now, we still don't know the identity of his wife, the timeline of their relationship, or the name of their daughter.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We do, however, know that Helms' baby girl is five years old, likely turning six, this year. While it's frustrating to some fans to not have this information, we can't help but applaud Ed for the hard work he has put in to allow his family to live a (mostly) normal life.</p><h2 id=who-is-ed-helms>Who Is Ed Helms?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/EdHelmsTheHangoverPartII.jpg><p>Helms is a veteran Hollywood actor who is known for his work on television and film. Even today, fans still remember Helms for his portrayal of salesman/regional sales manager Andy Bernard in the Emmy-winning series The Office. Around the same time, Helms also joined the cast of the hit sitcom Arrested Development.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/The-Office-Andy-Erin-wedding.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Meanwhile, on the big screen, Helms was cast to play Stu in The Hangover movies, which has become a massively successful franchise. Over the years, he also starred in several other movies. These include I Do… Until I Don’t, Love the Coopers, Chappaquiddick, Father Figures, Corporate Animals, Tag, Coffee & Kareem, and Together Together. Most recently, Helms has also been starring in the tv series Rutherford Falls, a show where he also serves as an executive producer.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Was The Hardest Episode To Film, According To The Cast Of The Office</a></span></p><h2 id=ed-helms-keeps-his-wife-and-private-life-private>Ed Helms Keeps His Wife And Private Life... Private!</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Ed-helms-driving.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Helms may be a constant presence on film and television, but the actor tends to keep to himself when he’s not on the set. In fact, to this day, Helms hasn’t disclosed the name of his wife during interviews. And while he’s said that they share a daughter, Helms hasn’t mentioned the name of his little girl either.</p><p>While this is rather rare for someone as big as Ed Helms is in Hollywood, it's evident he prefers to keep things on the down-low. With countless celebs being swarmed by paparazzi, or constantly asked invasive questions about their private life, it's clear Ed just wants to act, and that's it!</p><h2 id=here-39-s-what-ed-helms-has-said-about-his-wife>Here's What Ed Helms Has Said About His Wife</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That said, Helms had mentioned both ladies in his life from time to time. For instance, when Helms was on Jimmy Kimmel Live, he did talk about his wife a little bit, describing her and her side of the family as “outdoorsy,” so much so that they decided to go camping for a vacation. Interestingly, Helms also admitted he doesn’t quite have the same love for camping (or the outdoors).</p><p>While on the show, Helms also mentioned a hilarious story about the time when he was rumored to be <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">having an affair with actress Demi Moore</a>. It all happened while he and his family were away on vacation and the actor suddenly got a call from his publicist. As it turns out, his wife was more amused about it than anything else. Helms recalled, “Before I can say anything, they go, ’Demi Moore, high five! Can you believe this tabloid thought that you and Demi Moore could be a couple?’” The actor also said that he is “happily married.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's The Cast Of The Office, Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><p>As for Helms’ little girl, Kimmel tried to get her name live on his show, but Helms only responded, “Her name, weirdly, is Jimmy Kimmel.” The actor even hilariously claimed that his daughter was named after his grandmother. Meanwhile, in some of his recent interviews, Helms also took the time to share stories about his daughter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/4ACF7053-17BA-420C-9549-3E9021160EFA.jpeg><p>For instance, Helms opened up about his “brutal battle” with reducing his daughter’s time in front of the television. While making a virtual appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, the actor recalled a recent road trip that he had taken with his wife and daughter.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“We can put an iPad up, and it's just like the greatest thing in the world to her. And actually, it kept her pretty chill for this extremely long drive,” Helms explained. “But it was also maybe a miscalculation because when a kid doesn't get much TV and then gets this massive dose, it's like heroin.” The actor shared that it was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">hard to pry the gadget away</a> after that. “It is a brutal battle trying to readjust a child to no TV.”</p><p>And while promoting Coffee and Kareem, Helms also shared how the family had been since they found themselves staying at home more during the COVID shutdown. “So, we’re trying to be there for our child and each other and also give each other some space,” Helms explained while speaking with Uproxx. “I mean, you know what, all things considered, it’s going well. We just don’t have a lot to complain about given what so many other people are going through.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ed-helms-talks-more-about-his-work>Ed Helms Talks More About His Work</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/warner-bros-almost-had-to-delay-the-hangover-part-ii-release-because-of-a-lawsuit-from-mike-tyson-s-tattoo-artist.jpg><p>While Helms rarely mentions his wife or daughter during interviews, this veteran actor is usually more than happy to discuss the roles he’s played over the years. For instance, he readily gave an insight into how his Office character would fare in the midst of a pandemic.</p><p>“It depends on when in the series you catch Andy. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">There are moments where he’s almost manic</a>,” Helms told Entertainment Weekly. “That’s the Andy that would really spin out during quarantine.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite the lack of mention of his wife (or daughter), it’s become clear that Helms values his family more than anything in the world. For now, everyone just has to respect the fact that he wants to keep some things private. Hopefully, his wife and/or little girl will make a cameo in one of his films or shows in the future.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBuscNmn56knah6tLHCq5ytZaees6Z7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./title-eminem-drops-the-eminem-show-deluxe-with-ja-rule-diss-featuring-50-cent-tony-yayo-lloyd-banks.html><span>←</span><span>Eminem Drops New Edition Of 'The Eminem Show' With Ja Rule Diss</span></a>
