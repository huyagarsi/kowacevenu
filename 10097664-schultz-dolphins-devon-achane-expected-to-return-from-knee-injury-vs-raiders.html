In four games, the rookie sensation racked up 460 rushing yards and five touchdowns on just 38 carries, averaging a whopping 12.1 yards per rush. He also added nine catches for 67 yards and two more scores.</p><p>Without Achane in the lineup, Miami's high-powered offense wasn't as potent. The team failed to record 100 rushing yards in two of the four games he missed.</p><p>Despite his injury, Achane continued to travel with the Dolphins and was even in attendance for their Week 9 game in Germany against the Kansas City Chiefs. Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa told ESPN's <a href=# rel=noopener>Marcel Louis-Jacques</a> that Achane's presence makes a huge difference for the team even though he's a rookie.</p><p>"I think the coolest thing about someone like him being a rookie is just who he is as a person," Tagovailoa said. "How you see him on the sideline, just chill, relaxed, that's who he is, and that's how he is in the huddle. To be able to go in the huddle and see someone like that, it's very promising to know that, OK, he knows where he's going to line up, and then basically if he's getting the ball, you know it's going to be a big play more often than not."</p><p>Achane's return comes at the perfect time, as he will be facing a Raiders defense that allows 135.6 yards per game, the fourth-worst mark in the NFL. Achane and fellow speedster Raheem Mostert could be in for big days in Las Vegas.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloaWyDd4CMrJqhrZypx26wzqWnoaGeqHqlsdWopWaZk52ur7GMnq%2BpnZOpsqV506hkq52kqr%2BvecWrpqZlm6OypnnIp6Guqqliw7R50ZqgnZ2iqA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./school-event-to-study-for-html.html><span>←</span><span>School event to study for</span></a>
