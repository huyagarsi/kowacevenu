The teen queen of the '80s <strong>Molly Ringwald</strong> can't leave her John Hughes days behind — and neither can her kids! The actress came across a cardboard cutout of her Sixteen Candles character Samantha Baker during a recent shopping trip with her 10-year-old daughter <strong>Mathilda</strong> on Tuesday, Aug. 19.</p><p>"She can't escape her mom, even when 'back to school' shopping at Target," Ringwald, 46, <a href=#>captioned via Twitter.</a> In a sweet snapshot, Mathilda stood next to a movie display case and emulated Baker's stance. (Ringwald also is mom to 5-year-old twins<strong> Roman</strong> and <strong>Adele </strong>with husband <strong>Panio Gianopoulos</strong>.)</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Ringwald rose to fame in the 1984 Hughes film, where her angsty character experienced every embarrassment possible during her 16th birthday. Despite having to deal with The Geek (<strong>Anthony Michael Hall</strong>) and Long Duk Dong (<strong>Gedde Watanabe</strong>), Baker eventually ended up blowing out her candles with high school dreamboat Jake Ryan (<strong>Michael Schoeffling</strong>).</p><p>Ringwald continued her success with several other Hughes classics, including 1985's The Breakfast Club and Pretty in Pink the following year. (Oh, Blane!). Her most recent notable role was in ABC Family's The Secret Life of the American Teenager.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKSopJyuerO1zaCumqSUqHqlrdSgn62domK6osDHoqOdmV2YtaK6zZ6jrGWjnsW1scSnZJyZnpm5pr%2BMnJ%2BaqpGYwaa%2BjGZpaWlkZ315</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./maksim-chmerkovskiy.html><span>←</span><span>Maksim Chmerkovskiy News - Us Weekly</span></a>
