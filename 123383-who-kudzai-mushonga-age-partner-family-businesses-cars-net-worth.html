He was born in Village Way in Borrowdale, Brook Harare. However, Kudzai Mushonga's age and early life details remain unknown. Also, not much information is known about the Kudzai Mushonga's family.</p><h2>Are Khanyi and Kudzai still together?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/afd689320d316fcd.jpg><p class=align-left>Yes, according to a post made by <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Khanyi Mbau</a> during Valentine this year where she received a Valentine's card and some roses and balloons from her man. During 2021 Valentines, the couple's love life had made headlines after she had received a private performance by a violinist, more than 1000 roses and several Louis Vuitton gifts.</p><p class=align-left>There is no relationship without its version of highs and lows. For Khanyi and Kudzai, they have also had their fair share of such moments. The couple made headlines towards the end of 2021 whilst on their <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">vacation in Dubai</a>. This is after <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Khanyi failed to return home</a> by 2 am after visiting the salon. Instead, the heartbroken man went to his Instagram handle and shared a video that shocked most of their fans.</p><p class=align-left>The following day, the distressed man went back to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram and confirmed</a> that his sweetheart had made her way back to South <a href=#>Africa</a> without him knowing about it.</p>I can confirm that my sweetheart is in South Africa.I am hurt, guys. They say men don't cry, but this one is deep. I just called my brother and told him that 'man, I just video called Khanyi now she is in South Africa. We have been in Dubai for a bit.

Kudzai then deleted the videos after penning an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">emotional apology to his girlfriend</a>.</p>I would like to apologise to my woman Mrs K (Khanyi Mbau), for taking our private life on IG (Instagram). I was hurting; I honestly didn't know how to deal with my emotions. Baby, I love you, video calling you this morning jus' made me realise how much I miss you, reminds me how you used to watch me sleep on video in the beginning, the butterflies.I miss you, my love; I'm not ashamed to stand on top of the world and admit I love you! You became my world, my everything. Someone help me tell my woman I love her and I miss her! Baby, you know me; I'm still where you left me! Jus' trying to control my feelings! I love you, and I'm sorry.<p class=align-left>Khanyi, who is an <a href=#>actress</a>, recently praised her man Kudzai for being supportive of her dreams. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">She is quoted saying</a>;</p>Your level of support, baby, the way you let me chase my dreams and want to see become the best in all I do is incredible and honestly the wind beneath my wind.My silent cheerleader and fighter, my family, my guide. How do you do it? Truly beats me.
