Keep reading to check out our review of the concert!</p><p>Aleem is the support act for this segment of the tour. He really got the crowd ready for Little Mix, particularly in his last track, where the audience were all up dancing. If you haven’t already, you should definitely check him out over on his&nbsp;<a href=#>official Twitter</a>. He is also embarking on his debut UK and Ireland tour during 2018. Further details and tickets can be found&nbsp;<a href=#>by clicking here</a>.</p><p>A preview of new track ‘Is Your Love Enough?’ was played, which increased the excitement for the band’s appearance on stage. After an interval, it was then time for the main act: Little Mix. The introductory visual took the audience on a journey down a country lane, speeding up near the end to show the faces of Perrie, Jesy, Jade and Leigh-Anne.</p><p>When the visual ended, the four-piece appeared on stage. Their set began with empowering anthem ‘Power.’ Following on from their first track, they went on to perform Number 1 hit ‘Black Magic,’ which had everyone singing and dancing along.</p><p>Prior to their singing ‘F.U.,’ Leigh-Anne spoke on behalf of the band, saying that all four of them were now in happy, committed relationships and that ‘F.U.’ was a message written to the boys who had broke their hearts in the past, also explaining that during the writing process for the ‘Glory Days’ album, the band experienced a range of emotions.</p><p>The band didn’t forget some of their older classics, which include ‘Move’ and ‘Wings.’ In particular, for one segment of the show, the crowd interaction was phenomenal. There was a walk way out over the crowd, which allowed Little Mix to truly interact with the audience.</p><p>What was particularly impressive was the visual prior to ‘Salute.’ The visual was clearly extremely well thought out and featured messages that provided encouragement to their fans, many of whom have been helped by Little Mix’s music.</p><p>Alongside their timeless classics, the band also performed several tracks from their most recent album, including ‘Touch,’ ‘Down and Dirty’ and ‘Nothing Else Matters’ – to name but a few!</p><p>At one point, they even got a member of the audience up on stage to join them in a game played with the crowd!</p><p>The audience were ready for one last song – and the screams in the arena for an encore were truly indescribable. Of course, one main song hadn’t been performed: ‘Shout Out To My Ex.’ The audience were truly in an euphoric mood during this song, and security were well and truly defeated – they couldn’t keep everyone sat down. Everyone was up singing and dancing to the ultimate, upbeat break-up anthem!</p><p>With everything for the phenomenal dance breaks, jaw-dropping vocals, Jerrie moments, the level of friendship that exists, the ‘Glory Days Tour’ certainly did not leave us disappointed.</p><h4>Have you been to a ‘Glory Days’ tour date?
