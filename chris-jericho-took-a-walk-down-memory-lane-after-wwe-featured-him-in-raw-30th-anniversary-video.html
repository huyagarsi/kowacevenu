WWE Raw is set to feature appearances from multiple WWE Hall of Famers and veterans, including Shawn Michaels and The Undertaker, both of whom have notably appeared on the first episode of Raw. Chris Jericho isn’t going to be around, since he is under AEW contract, but he was still a part of RAW’s illustrious history.</p><p>The first episode of WWE Raw aired in January 1993. Since then the show has established itself as an integral part of pop culture, and it couldn’t have been possible without the contribution of wrestling icons such as The Rock, John Cena, Triple H, Stone Cold Steve Austin just to name a few.</p><p>In a <a href=#>promotional video</a> that aired during SmackDown for the momentous RAW occasion, WWE featured a montage of many big names within its rich pro wrestling history, many of whom are no longer with the company. The montage also featured stars who are now working in rival promotions, such as Mark Henry, Bryan Danielson and the Ocho Chris Jericho.</p><p>The video took Jericho down memory lane, featuring some of his biggest moments. The Ocho replied to the tweet, appreciating the fact that pro wrestling is bigger than promotions.</p><p>Pro wrestling transcends any given company. Pro wrestling is about memories….and this video contains some LEGENDARY ones!</p><p><a href=#>The show is set to feature appearances from many big names in its past.</a> While Chris Jericho and other former WWE superstars in the AEW won’t be part of the show, it is good to know that the WWE has acknowledged their efforts to the company.
