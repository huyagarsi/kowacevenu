His unique style and passion for music made him a beloved figure among listeners and musicians alike.</p><p>Jim was born and raised in Los Angeles, Ladd began his journey in radio at KNAC in Long Beach before moving on to the legendary KMET, where he quickly became a fan favorite. His tenure at KMET marked the beginning of what would become a storied career in FM rock radio.</p><p>In the 1970s, as rock music began to dominate the airwaves, Ladd moved to KLOS, where he spent 14 years as the midday host.

This approach earned him a loyal following and cemented his reputation as a true pioneer in the industry.</p><p>Ladd’s influence extended beyond the radio waves. He was the inspiration behind Tom Petty’s album ‘The Last DJ’, a tribute to the DJs who dared to play what they wanted, not just what the charts dictated.</p><p>After leaving KLOS, Ladd found a new home at SiriusXM, where he hosted a show on the Deep Tracks channel for 12 years. His passion for music and his distinctive voice continued to resonate with listeners, even in the age of digital streaming.</p><p>Ladd’s passing has elicited tributes from across the music world, with many expressing their sorrow at the loss of a man who was not just a DJ, but a true champion of rock music. His contributions to the industry have left an indelible mark on the landscape of radio broadcasting.</p><p>Jim Ladd’s life was a testament to his love for music and his commitment to sharing that love with his listeners. He was a true icon in the world of rock radio, and his voice will be deeply missed.</p><p>As we mourn the loss of this legendary figure, our thoughts go out to his family, friends, and all those touched by his life and work. His legacy will continue to live on through the music he loved so much.</p><p><strong>More From BRBNEWS: <a href=#>Deputy Joshua Hamilton and Driver Michael Gayhart II Tragically Killed in Preble County Crash</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaopewsLjLnp6eZpmjfKu1zGajmpyUYrGqscNmoJynnp6wbrjOrGSappeauaa%2FjKumnKNdp66ltc5mm6NlkaOxbr%2FIq6Cuq6iieqm70q1krK2TmMKursSdZK2nXZ2yor7TZpitrJGYuHA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./carrie-underwoods-tour-mate-gives-mike-fisher-marital-advice-always-say-yes-2010313.html><span>←</span><span>Carrie Underwood's Tour Mate Gives Mike Fisher Marital Advice: Always Say &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot;</span></a>
